# Avatar or Mortal Engines? Predicting Movie Profitability from Scripts
As mentioned in the writeup, our project had two stages: Trial 1, in which we focused on predicting profitability of a movie solely based on its full script; and Trial 2, in which we predicted "Freshness" of a movie based on its synopsis and other non-textual features.   
Below you can find the commands that replicate our results.
