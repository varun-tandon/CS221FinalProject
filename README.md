# Avatar or Mortal Engines? Predicting Movie Profitability from Scripts
As mentioned in the writeup, our project had two stages: Trial 1, in which we focused on predicting profitability of a movie solely based on its full script; and Trial 2, in which we predicted "Freshness" of a movie based on its synopsis and other non-textual features.   
Below you can find the commands that replicate our results. 

## Trial 1
Feature extraction - python trial_1_feature_extraction.py  
Training - python trial_1_training.py  
 
## Trial 2
Feature extraction - python trial_2_feature_extraction.py  
Training - python trial_2_training.py
