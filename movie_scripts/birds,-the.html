                     FINAL DRAFT 2nd Revision March 2, 1962

<b>                
</b>
<b>	FADE IN:
</b>
<b>	FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
</b>
	It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the 
	people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the 
	policemen directing traffic.

<b>	PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS
</b>
	waiting at street corner for light to change.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MAN
</b>
	at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the 
	sky.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM
</b>
	as she follows his gaze upward.

<b>	LONG SHOT - THE SKY
</b>
	with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling.

<b>	MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER
</b>
	as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd 
	walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling 
	gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES:

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS
</b>
	in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.  
	She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, 
	exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick 
	sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, 
	a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the 
	front door of a pet shop and enters.

<b>	INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT
</b>
	Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back 
	toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.  
	MacGRUDER, comes toward her.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever 
		seen so many gulls?

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		Hello, Miss Daniels.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What do you suppose it is?

<b>	MED. SHOT
</b>
	Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is 
	BARKING, o.s.

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>			(shaking her head)
		There must be a storm at sea. That 
		can drive them inland, you know.

	They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird 
	department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor 
	of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie 
	and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There 
	is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls 
	are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so 
	that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained 
	birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic 
	birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, 
	larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets 
	in the bigger cages. As they walk:

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		I was hoping you'd be a little late, 
		Miss Daniels.
			(apologetically)
		You see, he hasn't arrived yet.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		You said three o'clock.

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		I know. Oh, I know.
			(she is more distressed 
			now)
		I've been calling all morning. Oh, 
		you have no idea. Miss Daniels, 
		they're so difficult to get, really 
		they are. We get them from India, 
		you know, when they're just little 
		chicks, and then we have to...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Well, this one won't be a chick, 
		will he?

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly 
		not. This will be a full grown myna 
		bird. Full grown.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		And he'll talk?

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. 
		You'll have to teach him to talk.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		Yes.
			(pause)
		Oh my, I suppose I should call them 
		again. They said three o'clock.
			(pause)
		Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.  
		Would you mind waiting?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(judiciously)
		I think maybe you'd better deliver 
		him. Let me give you my address.
			(she begins taking 
			off her gloves)

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>			(producing pencil and 
			pad)
		Oh. Oh, well, all right.

	As Melanie starts writing:

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		I'm sure they're on the way, though.  
		Could I just call?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(with a resigned sigh)
		Well, all right, but...

	She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight.  Melanie 
	finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the 
	counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)
</b>		Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at 
		Davidson's.
			(pause; accusingly)
		It's past three, you know.
			(pause)
		Well, how long do you think...? All 
		right, would you check it please?  
		Yes, I'll wait.

	Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, 
	she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips 
	with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding 
	her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the 
	bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins 
	BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER
</b>
	as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the 
	steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about 
	twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt 
	hat.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of 
	strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.  
	The birds are startled into scarlet flight.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little 
	nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes 
	her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and 
	then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of 
	the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I wonder if you could help me.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What?

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(deliberately, and 
			with a touch of 
			hauteur)
		I said I wonder if you could help 
		me.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to 
	inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But 
	then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea 
	comes to her.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(solicitously)
		Yes, what was it you were looking 
		for, sir?

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>			(deadpan)
		Lovebirds.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Lovebirds, sir?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Yes. I understand there are different 
		varieties, it that true?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Well... yes, sir, there are.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		These are for my sister... her 
		birthday you see. As she'll be eleven 
		and... well, frankly, I wouldn't 
		want a pair of birds that were too 
		demonstrative.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I understand completely, sir.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		As the same time, I wouldn't want 
		birds that were aloof, either.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(leading him around 
			shop)
		No, of course not.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Do you have a pair that are just 
		friendly?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I think so, sir.
			(she looks around)
		Now then, let me see.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(at the finches)
		Aren't these lovebirds?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No, sir, those are... redbirds.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		The sign says strawberry finches.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(airily)
		Yes, we call them that too.
			(she moves away)
		Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
			(and stops before a 
			cage of canaries)

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Those are canaries, Miss.
			(pause)
		Doesn't this make you feel awful?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(baffled)
		Doesn't what make me...?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		All these innocent little creatures 
		caged up like this?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Well, we can't just let them fly 
		around the shop, you know.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I suppose not. Is there an 
		ornithological reason for keeping 
		them in separate cages?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Oh, certainly. It's to protect the 
		species.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I imagine that's very important.  
		Especially during the moulting season.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes, that's a particularly dangerous 
		time.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Are they moulting now?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Some of them are.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		How can you tell?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Well... they get a sort of hangdog 
		expression.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V.
</b>
	The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Yes, I see.
			(pause)
		About those lovebirds, Miss...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Are you sure you wouldn't like to 
		see a canary instead? We have some 
		very nice canaries this week.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		All right.
			(he smiles)
		She smiles back.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(he waits)
		All right, may I see one, please?

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries 
	out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter 
	where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, 
	and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary 
	cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(feebly)
		Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.

	One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and 
	into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Oh!  Ohhhhh!

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT
</b>
	as the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and 
	Mitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter, 
	finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all 
	day.

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the 
		birds is loose!

	She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up 
	to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches 
	them suspiciously.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Shhh! Shhhh!

	He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers 
	the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	the canary in his hand.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		There we are!

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT
</b>
	as Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the 
	door.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(putting the canary 
			in)
		Back into your gilded cage, Melanie 
		Daniels.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	startled.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What did you say?

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>			(savoring this)
		I was merely drawing a parallel, 
		Miss Daniels.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		But how... how do you know my name?

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(secretly)
		A little birdie told me.
			(he smiles politely)
		Good day, Miss Daniels.
			(he bows to Mrs.  
			MacGruder)
		Madam.
			(he starts out)

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Hey, wait a minute!

	She goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her 
	bafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then:

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I don't know you.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Ahhh, but I know you.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		How?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		We met in court.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		We never met in court or anyplace 
		else.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw 
		you in court.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		When?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Do you remember one of your practical 
		jokes that resulted in the smashing 
		of a plate glass window?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I didn't break that window!

<b>				MITCH
</b>		No, but your little prank did. The 
		judge should have put you behind 
		bars!

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What are you? A policeman?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I simply believe in the law, Miss 
		Daniels, and I'm not too keen on 
		practical jokers.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What do you call your lovebird story 
		if not a practical...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Ahhh, but I really do want those 
		birds.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		You knew I didn't work here. You 
		deliberately...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Right. I recognized you when I came 
		in. I thought you might like to know 
		what it felt like to be on the other 
		end of a gag. What do you think of 
		that, Miss Daniels?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I think you're a louse.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I am.
			(he tips his hat)
		Good day.
			(to Mrs. MacGruder)
		Madam.
			(and he goes down the 
			steps)

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		And I'm glad you didn't get your 
		lovebirds!

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(breezily, as he goes 
			out)
		I'll find something else.
			(he gives a slight 
			bow)
		See you in court some day.

	The door closes. The puppy begins BARKING.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(angrily)
		That... that... who was that?

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		I have no idea.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	seething as she stares after him. Suddenly, she gets an idea.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	going down the steps and to the front door of the shop. She 
	looks through the glass.

<b>	LONG SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
</b>
	getting into his car at the curb.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	looking after the car at the curb.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE LICENSE PLATE CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	seeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod. She 
	begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	as she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE - MRS. MACGRUDER'S P.O.V.
</b>
	as she comes up to the counter.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Have you got a pencil?

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		What? Oh, yes, certainly.

	As Melanie begins writing:

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		They said the myna bird would be 
		here later this afternoon. If you'd 
		care to come back...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No, you'd better send him. May I use 
		your phone?

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>			(bewildered by 
			everything)
		Yes, certainly.
			(she puts phone on 
			counter)

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(as she dials)
		Do you have any lovebirds?

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		No, not in the shop. But I can order 
		them for you.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		How soon?

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		Well... well, how soon would you 
		want them?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Immediately.
			(into phone)
		Is this the Daily News? Melanie 
		Daniels. Would you get me the city 
		desk, please?

<b>				MRS. MACGRUDER
</b>		I might be able to have them by 
		tomorrow morning. Would that be all 
		right?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(with an edged anger)
		That would be just fine.
			(into phone)
		Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I 
		want you to do a favor for me.
			(pause)
		No, this is a small one.
			(pause)
		Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, 
		would I try to pressure you?  Will 
		you call the Department of Motor 
		Vehicles for me and find out who 
		owns this license plate? DKQ dash 
		one seven six.
			(pause)
		Yes, a California plate.
			(pause)
		No, I'll stop up there in a little 
		while. Is daddy in his office?
			(pause)
		Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in 
		on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see 
		him later. Thank you, Charlie.
			(she hangs up)

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE ICY DETERMINATION ON HER FACE.
</b>
<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Now. What time tomorrow morning?

<b>	FADE IN:
</b>
<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S SPORTS CAR
</b>
	pulling up in front of Mitch's building, the top down. She 
	glances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around 
	to the other side, and opens the door.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
</b>
	in a cage as Melanie reaches for them.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	turning from the car and going into the building. She pauses 
	in the lobby, studies the names alongside the bell buttons.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND
</b>
	running down the list of names slowly. It stops.

<b>	INSERT - THE CARD
</b>
	her finger beside it.

<b>	BRENNER, M. 3B
</b>
	CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND the forefinger extended as she 
	runs it down over every bell button in one column, and then 
	does the same for the next column.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	as she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby, 
	grabbing the knob. A BUZZ SOUNDS. She opens the door.

<b>	REVERSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	coming through the door and into the lobby. She walks swiftly 
	toward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing, 
	waiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with 
	answering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the 
	elevator, silently. Behind her, the BUZZING STOPS. The 
	elevator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows 
	her to enter first. She does so with a small nod.  The 
	elevator doors close.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR
</b>
	The birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and 
	Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander 
	down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him.  Self-
	consciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds. 
	The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The 
	doors begin to open.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	stepping out of the elevator as the doors open. The man is 
	right behind her. She begins looking for apartment 3B. The 
	man is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in 
	front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn 
	the corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment 
	just opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key. 
	He looks at Melanie.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	smiling at him feebly.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR
</b>
	The man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm 
	of his hand as he searches for his key. Impatiently, Melanie 
	watches him. Making a decision, she puts the birdcage down 
	before the door to apartment 3B, and then opens her purse.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE'S GLOVED HAND
</b>
	reaching into the purse for a white envelope.

<b>	INSERT - THE FACE OF THE ENVELOPE
</b>
	written there in Melanie's handwriting: MR. MITCHELL BRENNER.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	as she props the envelope against the cage, and then hurriedly 
	goes down the hallway, intent on retreat.

<b>				MAN'S VOICE
</b>		Miss...?  She stops, distressed.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR
</b>
	the man at the one end, key in his hand; Melanie at the other 
	end, near the elevator.

<b>				MAN
</b>		Is that for Mitch Brenner?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(curtly)
		Yes.

<b>				MAN
</b>		He's not home.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		That's all right.

	She presses button for the elevator.

<b>				MAN
</b>		He won't be back until Monday. I 
		mean, if those birds are for him....

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Monday?

<b>				MAN
</b>		Yes. I don't think you should leave 
		them in the hall, do you?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(trapped)
		Well, I...

	The elevator doors open.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Well, where did he go?

<b>				MAN
</b>		Bodega Bay. He goes up there every 
		weekend.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Bodega Bay? Where's that?

<b>				MAN
</b>		Up on the coast. About sixty miles 
		north of here.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Sixty...
			(her face falls)
		Oh.

<b>				MAN
</b>		About an hour and a half on the 
		freeway. Or two if you take the coast 
		highway.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Oh.

<b>				MAN
</b>		I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm 
		going away myself. Someone's got to 
		feed them, I suppose.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(in utter despair now)
		Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.

<b>				MAN
</b>			(apologetically)
		I'm awfully sorry.

	He puts the key into his lock, opens the door, and goes 
	inside. The door closes. Melanie is alone in the hallway.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	exasperated. She looks at the open elevator. She turns to 
	look at the birds.

<b>	LONG SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
</b>
	in their cage outside the apartment door, CHATTERING.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	surrendering with a gesture of resignation. She walks down 
	the hall, picks up envelope and puts it in her purse, picks 
	up the bird cage, carries it back to the elevator. The birds 
	are COOING and CHIRPING madly.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Oh, shut up!

	And she steps into the elevator.

<b>							  DISSOLVE
</b>
<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S OPEN CAR - (MATTE)
</b>
	on the coast highway. It is a spectacularly beautiful day, 
	with a cloudless blue sky. The montage of SHOTS that follow 
	should alternate between the winding, twisting road and the 
	ocean below, and CLOSEUPS of Melanie driving with the caged 
	birds on the seat beside her. The last shot should be a FULL 
	SHOT of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	She turns wheel forcefully.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
</b>
	in the cage as the car rounds the bend. They lean to one 
	side as the car turns, come up straight again as the car 
	rounds the curve.

<b>	FULL SHOT - (MATTE)
</b>
	Car approaching Bodega Bay seen high up.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	at the wheel, she glances out toward the bay.

<b>	FULL SHOT - A CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS AT WATERFRONT
</b>
	ahead, through the windshield as the car approaches.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	behind the wheel, leaning forward slightly for a look at the 
	town.

<b>	LONG SHOT - DOCKS ON LEFT
</b>
	through the windshield as Melanie slows her speed.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	behind wheel.

<b>	LONG SHOT - STORES
</b>
	on right of the road as Melanie enters the town. SLOW PAN 
	matching car's cruise past BAKERY, SHOE REPAIR, CLEANERS, 
<b>	RADIO AND TELEVISION.
</b>
<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	behind wheel.

<b>	LONG SHOT - THE TIDES
</b>
	past the gas station and beyond to the parking area and the 
	docks, continuing Melanie's slow observation of the place.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - (PROCESS)
</b>
	studying the town. The car turns into road by gas station.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE TOWN
</b>
	through the windshield. The car turns right. There is life 
	in the town now, fishermen crossing the road, women with 
	their hair in curlers, old ladies carrying shopping bags.  
	This is Saturday morning, and the town -- such as it is -- 
	is alive with its inhabitants. We see them from Melanie's

<b>	P.O.V. AS SHE SCANS THE PLACE FOR ITS POST OFFICE. (THIS TO 
</b><b>	BE TAKEN ON BACK LOT.)
</b>
<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CAR
</b>
	pulling in, in front of the post office. Melanie opens the 
	door and steps out. She is smartly dressed in a traveling 
	suit and sweater. She looks up at the sign, and then walks 
	quickly toward the front door.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	enters post office.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK
</b>
	behind cage as Melanie approaches it. He is busy filling out 
	a form of some kind, affixing stamps to it, etc. He does not 
	look up as she approaches.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	through the bars of the cage.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Good morning.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK
</b>
<b>				CLERK
</b>			(without looking up)
		Morning.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK
</b>
<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I wonder if you could help me.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Try my best.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'm looking for a man named Mitchell 
		Brenner.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Yep.

	He is still busy with his form, still does not look up.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Do you know him?

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Yep.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Where does he live?

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Right here. Bodega Bay.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes, but where?

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Right across the bay there.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Where?

	It seems as if the Clerk will not answer her. Suddenly, he 
	leaves the window.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	through the bars, exasperated.

<b>	REVERSE SHOT - FULL - MELANIE
</b>
	as she tries to peek through the bars to see where he's 
	vanished. A door to the left of the window opens, and the 
	Clerk steps out. He walks a little distance as Melanie watches 
	him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if 
	he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock 
	still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then 
	that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither 
	speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at 
	her, then looks out across the town and the bay. He extends 
	his arm and points.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		See where I'm pointing?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes?

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE BAY - THEIR P.O.V. - (MATTE)
</b>
<b>				CLERK (O.S.)
</b>		See them two big trees across there?

<b>				MELANIE (O.S.)
</b>		Yes?

<b>				CLERK (O.S.)
</b>		And the white house?

<b>				MELANIE (O.S.)
</b>		That's where the Brenners live.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK
</b>
<b>				MELANIE
</b>		The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		The two kids?

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Yep. Mitch and the little girl.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I see. How do I get down there?

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Follow the road straight through 
		town 'til it curves off on the left.  
		That'll take you right around the 
		bay to their front door.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		The front door.
			(pause)
		Isn't there a back road I can take?

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Nope. That's the road. Straight 
		through town, stay on your left, 
		right around the bay to the front 
		door.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		You see, I wanted to surprise them.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Mmmm.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I didn't want to come right down the 
		road, where they could see me.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Mmmm.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		It's a surprise, you see.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Mmmmmm.
			(long pause)
		'Course, you could get yourself a 
		boat, cut right across the bay with 
		it. The Brenners got a little dock 
		there you could tie up at. If that's 
		what you wanted to do.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Where would I get a boat?

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Down at the dock by the Tides 
		Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard 
		boat?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(looking at him)
		Of course.

<b>				CLERK
</b>			(looks back at her)
		D'you want me to order one for you?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(surprised)
		Thank you.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		What name?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Daniels.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Okay.

	He nods briefly and goes inside. Melanie looks across the 
	bay.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE BAY - MELANIE'S P.O.V. - (MATTE)
</b>
<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	smiling. She gets a new idea. She reaches into her purse for 
	the envelope. She looks at the envelope, then tears it up 
	and stuffs the torn envelope into her handbag. She turns 
	back toward the post office.

<b>	INT. THE POST OFFICE - FULL SHOT
</b>
	as Melanie approaches the Clerk's window. He is still busy, 
	still does not look up.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I wonder if you could tell me...

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Yep?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		The little girl's name.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		The little Brenner girl?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Alice, I think.
			(he turns, shouts to 
			someone in rear)
		Harry, what's the little Brenner 
		girl's name?

<b>				HARRY'S VOICE
</b>			(shouting)
		What?

<b>				CLERK
</b>			(shouting)
		The little Brenner girl.

<b>				HARRY'S VOICE
</b>			(shouting)
		Lois!

<b>				CLERK
</b>			(shouting)
		It's Alice, ain't it?

<b>				HARRY'S VOICE
</b>			(shouting)
		No, it's Lois!

<b>				CLERK
</b>			(to Melanie)
		It's Alice.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Are you sure?

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Well, I ain't positive, if that's 
		what you mean.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I need her exact name, you see.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		That case, I tell you what you do.  
		You go straight through town 'til 
		you see a little hotel on your left 
		there. Not the motel, that's the 
		other end of town. This is the hotel. 
		Now you take a right turn there, you 
		got that?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes?

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Near the top of the hill, you'll see 
		the school and right behind it, the 
		church. You head for the school.  
		Now just past the school, you'll see 
		a little house with a red mail box.  
		That's where Annie Hayworth lives, 
		she's the school teacher. You ask 
		her about the little Brenner girl.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Yep.
			(pause)
		Could save yourself a lot of trouble. 
		Her name's Alice for sure.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Can I have the boat in about twenty 
		minutes?

	The Clerk nods.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		How much for the phone calls?

<b>				CLERK
</b>			(brushing this aside)
		It's nothing.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	grinning, as she makes for the door and EXITS.

<b>	EXT. GENERAL STORE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	getting into the car and slamming the door.

<b>							  DISSOLVE
</b>
	LONG SHOT (MATTE) - MELANIE'S CAR turning in school road.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S CAR
</b>
	passing the school and pulling up outside the teacher's house.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE RED MAIL BOX
</b>
	with the name "Hayworth" on it. PULL BACK to reveal:

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	passing the mail box and going up the walk to the front door.  
	The house is a two-story frame with steps leading to the 
	front door. There are white curtains in every window of the 
	house, and a sign in the window to the left of the doorway 
	advises, ROOM TO LET. Melanie rings the doorbell.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	waiting. She RINGS the bell again:

<b>				ANNIE'S VOICE
</b>			(shouting)
		Yes? Who is it?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Me!

<b>				ANNIE'S VOICE
</b>		Who's me?

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	walking along the porch of the house. The walk in front of 
	the house is lined with beautifully planted and cared-for 
	flowers. ANNIE HAYWORTH comes round from the back of the 
	house as Melanie reaches the corner. She is a woman of thirty-
	two, tall, big-boned, with a strong beautiful face.  Her 
	hair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the 
	garden, wearing slacks and a loose-fitting sweater, and earth-
	stained gloves. But there is something about her, a feeling 
	of expansive comfort, rather than sloppiness.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Miss Hayworth?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Yes?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to 
		bother you, but...

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
</b>
	She is puzzled by Melanie who, exquisitely dressed and 
	groomed, seems singularly out of place in Bodega Bay. She 
	studies her openly.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Yes?

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
</b>
<b>				MELANIE
</b>		The man at the post office sent me.  
		He said you'd know the name of the 
		little Brenner girl.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Cathy?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		The one who lives in the white house 
		across the bay?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		That's the one. Cathy Brenner.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(smiling)
		They seemed sure it was either Alice 
		or Lois.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Which is why the mail in this town 
		never gets delivered to the right 
		place.
			(She takes out package 
			of cigarettes, offers 
			one to Melanie)
		Did you want to see Cathy about 
		something?

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	taking cigarette, hesitating.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Well... not exactly.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
</b>
	studying her, thinking she understands.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Are you a friend of Mitch's?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No, not really.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
</b>
	There is an awkwardness here. Annie wants to know more. She 
	puffs on the cigarette, smiles, tries a friendly approach.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		I've been wanting a cigarette for 
		the past twenty minutes, but I 
		couldn't convince myself to stop.  
		This 'tilling of the soil' can get a 
		little compulsive, you know.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		It's a lovely garden.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Thank you. It gives me something to 
		do with my spare time.
			(pause)
		There's a lot of spare time in Bodega 
		Bay.
			(another pause)
		Did you plan on staying long?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No. Just a few hours.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		You're leaving after you see Cathy?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Well... something like that.
			(pause)
		I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so 
		mysterious.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Actually, it's none of my business.

	There is a pause. Melanie, by her silence, affirms that it 
	is none of Annie's business.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(putting out cigarette)
		I'd better get on my way. Thank you 
		very much.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Not at all.

	They begin walking toward the car.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(still curious)
		Did you drive up from San Francisco?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		It's a nice drive.
			(pause)
		Is that where you met Mitch?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(hesitating, then)
		Yes.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		I guess that's where everyone meets 
		him.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	as she gets in behind the wheel. Annie's remark is not lost 
	on her, and a quick look of sudden understanding crosses her 
	face.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss 
		Hayworth.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
</b>
	as Annie leans over the seat.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Do I?
			(she shakes her head, 
			smiles wistfully)
		No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.
			(pause)
		Or maybe a closed one.
			(she smiles again, 
			sees the lovebirds)
		Pretty. What are they?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Lovebirds.

	Taking this as a further indication of Melanie's relationship 
	with Mitch:

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Mmm.
			(pause)
		Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Thank you.

	She nods pleasantly, starts the car, pulls away.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
</b>
	watching the car, a look of sad resignation on her face.

<b>							  DISSOLVE
</b>
<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	coming out of Brinkmeyer's General Store, carrying a small 
	paper bag, walking toward her car out front. The CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS her as she gets in. She opens her purse and reaches 
	in for the paper bag.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - HER HANDS
</b>
	She pulls out a birthday card from the paper bag.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	reaching into her purse again for a fountain pen. She unscrews 
	the cap, braces the card on her closed purse.

<b>	INSERT - THE CARD
</b>
	Happy Birthday, the usual rhyming sentiments. The pen writes:

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S CAR
</b>
	crossing the highway down into the parking area behind the 
	Tides, close to the docks.

<b>	HIGH SHOT
</b>
	She gets out of the car and walks onto one of the docks, the 
	bird cage in her hand. Melanie approaches a waiting fisherman. 
	She asks for her boat. The fisherman nods. He leads her to 
	the dock and the waiting boat.  She gets into the outboard 
	motorboat, the fisherman helping her. He hands down the 
	lovebirds in their cage.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE BOAT
</b>
	pulling away from the dock, heading across the bay.

<b>	VERY LONG SHOT (MATTE) - THE BOAT
</b>
	and the wide expanse of the bay, as it heads on a direct 
	course for the house on the other side.

<b>	VERY LONG SHOT (MATTE)
</b>
	Another spectacular SHOT of the small boat.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE BOAT
</b>
	coming head-on toward CAMERA, Melanie at the tiller. She 
	cuts the motor. The motor drifts to a stop. The bay is silent 
	except for the cry of the gulls.

<b>	LONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
</b>
	There is not a sign of activity as the boat drifts just a 
	little closer. As Melanie watches, the front door opens and 
	a woman comes out, walks to a red pickup truck, starts the 
	engine. A little girl comes out of the house, goes to the 
	truck, gets in. The woman shouts something to a man -- Mitch 
	Brenner, probably, though it is difficult to tell from this 
	distance -- and he comes over to the truck.

	The truck grinds into gear, goes around the turnabout, and 
	heads down the road away from the farm, a huge cloud of dust 
	behind it. The farm is still again. Mitch stands looking 
	after the truck for a moment, and then begins walking up 
	toward the barn in the distance.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT
</b>
	watching, biting her lip.

<b>	LONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE
</b>
	Mitch reaching the barn and entering. Silence.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	picking up paddle from deck, beginning to paddle in toward 
	dock.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE BOAT
</b>
	edging in toward the dock. Closer, closer, Melanie puts down 
	the paddle. The boat drifts in.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	leaping ashore, tying up the boat, reaching down for the 
	cage. She climbs onto the dock and approaches the CAMERA 
	until she is in WAIST SHOT. The CAMERA STARTS to RECEDE in 
	front of her as she walks forward.

<b>	THE CAMERA MOVING TOWARD THE HOUSE AND BARN
</b>
	The barn door closed, still no sign of Mitch.

<b>	WAIST SHOT - MELANIE

	Coming off the dock and onto the lawn, the CAMERA still

	the lawn, glancing toward the barn, carrying the bird cage.

	CAMERA RETREATING in front of her: Excitement and anticipation 
	on her face. She wets her lips. The CAMERA PANS WITH her as 
	she goes to front door and lets herself in.

<b>	FULL SHOT - INT. THE BRENNER HOUSE ENTRY
</b>
	as the door opens. Melanie ENTERS quickly, and closes the 
	door behind her. She glances around for a moment, getting 
	her bearings. The house is silent.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	entering the dining room. Hastily, she puts the cage on the 
	dinning room table, props the card up against it, then glances 
	through the lace curtains on the dinning room window.

	leaps into Melanie's boat.

</b>
	in the boat.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		That was the damndest thing I ever

</b>		It deliberately came down at you --
		you're bleeding...

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	a thin line of blood trickling from the cut on top of her 
	head, down onto her forehead and cheek. She seems dazed.  
	She shakes her head in answer to him, then touches the top 
	of her head, looks at her bloody fingers, and then nods 
	weakly.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	concerned.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Come on, let's take care of that.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE DOCK

<b>				FISHERMAN
</b>		What happened, Mitch?

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(over his shoulder)
		A gull hit her.

<b>				FISHERMAN
</b>		A what?

	The CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they walk across the parking area 
	behind the Tides, and to the closest office. Mitch tries the 
	door knob. The door is locked.

<b>	INSERT - SIGN ON DOOR OUT TO LUNCH TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND

	as he tries door of next office. It, too, is locked.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Come on, we'd better go up to the 
		restaurant.

	They walk quickly up the slope to the Tides, establishing 
	gas station across the road, the collection of stores 
	opposite, the cars pulling in and out. Mitch opens the door 
	for her, and they ENTER.

<b>	INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT
</b>
	This is a small neighborhood restaurant, with the feeling of 
	a local hangout. There are fishermen lounging at the bar, 
	and a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines. Two 
	ladies in housedresses, with their hair in curlers, are 
	sitting at one of the booths, having coffee. The rear wall 
	of the restaurant is almost all window, looking out over the 
	bay and the parking area below. A television set over the 
	bar is going. The shots and horsehoof beats of an old Western 
	movie should be HEARD muted throughout following.  DEKE 
	CARTER, who owns the restaurant with his wife, alternates 
	his attention between serving his customers and watching the 
	Western. He looks up immediately when Mitch and Melanie ENTER.

<b>	MED. SHOT - THE BAR
</b>
	Mitch and Melanie coming over to it.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Deke, have you got a first aid kit 
		back there?

<b>				DEKE
</b>			(instantly alarmed)
		What happened?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Young woman cut herself.

<b>				DEKE
</b>		Shall I call the doctor?

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(accepting the first 
			aid kit)
		I don't think it's that serious.  
		You want to sit up here?

	Melanie climbs onto the stool.

<b>				DEKE
</b>		You cut yourself outside, Miss?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a 
		boat.

	He is rummaging around in the kit.

<b>				DEKE
</b>		I had a man trip and fall in the 
		parking lot once, sued me before I 
		could bat an eyelash.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I don't think Miss Daniels is going 
		to sue anybody.

<b>				DEKE
</b>			(doubtfully)
		Well, you're the lawyer.
			(goes to other end of 
			bar)

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	as he unscrews cap from bottle of peroxide.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What's that?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Just some peroxide. I want to clean 
		out the cut.

	He pours peroxide onto a gauze pad and begins swabbing the 
	cut. They are silent for several seconds. Then:

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		So you're a lawyer.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		That's right. What are you doing in 
		Bodega Bay?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Do you practice here?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		No, San Francisco. What are you...?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What kind of law?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Criminal.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Is that why you'd like to see everyone 
		behind bars?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Not everyone, Miss Daniels.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Only violators and practical jokers.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		That's right.

	As he swabs cut.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Ouch!

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I'm sorry.
			(pause)
		What are you doing up here?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Didn't you see the lovebirds?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		You came all the way up here to bring 
		me those birds?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		To bring your sister those birds.  
		You said it was her birthday.  
		Besides, I was coming up anyway.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		What for?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		To see a friend of mine.
			(she winces)
		Will you please be careful?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I'm sorry.
			(pause)
		Who's your friend?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Why...
			(pause, stymied)

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Yes?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(blurting the only 
			name she knows)
		Annie. Annie Hayworth.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Well, well, small world. Annie 
		Hayworth.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(realizing this was a 
			mistake)
		Yes.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		How do you know Annie?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(the lie getting deeper)
		We... we went to school together.  
		College.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Did you! Imagine that! How long will 
		you be staying?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Just a few... just a day or two... 
		the weekend.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I think we'll have to shave the hair. 
		Deke, have you got a razor?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(pulling away)
		Oh, no you don't!

<b>				MITCH
</b>		It's still bleeding a little. Here, 
		let me put this on.

	He takes up a tiny Band-Aid and, tearing the gauze off, says:

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Bend your head down. This little 
		Band-Aid won't show.

	He presses the tiny Band-Aid over the cut. Melanie takes a 
	mirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at 
	it. She covers her hair over it as Mitch says:

<b>				MITCH
</b>		So you came up to see Annie, huh?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I don't believe you.
			(grins)
		I think you came up to see me.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Why would I want to see you, of all 
		people?

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(shrugging)
		I don't know. But it seems to me you 
		must have gone to a lot of trouble 
		to find out who I was, and where I 
		lived and...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		It was no trouble at all. I simply 
		called my father's paper. Besides, I 
		was coming up here anyway, I already 
		told you...

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(grinning)
		You like me, huh?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I loathe you. You have no manners.  
		And you're arrogant and conceited 
		and... I wrote you a letter about 
		it, in fact, but I tore it up.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		What did it say?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		None of your business.
			(pause)
		Am I still bleeding?

	She lowers her head.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Can't see a thing.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I can't say I like your seagulls 
		much, either. I come all the way up 
		here to...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		But you were coming up anyway, 
		remember?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I was! And all I get for my pains is 
		a... a... a hole in the head!

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(grinning)
		Right next to the one you already 
		had.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(angrily)
		Look, Mr. Brenner...

<b>				LYDIA (O.S.)
</b>		Mitch?

	They turn toward the door.

<b>	MED. SHOT - LYDIA BRENNER
</b>
	closing the door behind her, coming toward the bar. She is a 
	woman in her late forties, attractive, wearing shirt, blouse, 
	cardigan sweater, low heels. There is nothing agrarian-looking 
	about her. She speaks with the quick tempo of the city 
	dweller, and there is lively inquiry in her eyes.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(puzzled)
		I thought I saw your car. What are 
		you doing in town?

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(rising to greet her)
		I had to acknowledge a delivery.
			(grins)
		Mother, I'd like you to meet...

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		A what?

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(continuing)
		Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
	Her eyebrows raising ever so slightly, not in displeasure, 
	but simply in enormous curiosity as she acknowledge the 
	introduction.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		How do you do, Miss Daniels?
			(to Mitch)
		Acknowledge a what?

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>		A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels 
		brought some birds from San Francisco.

	Lydia thinks she understands. This is one of Mitch's San 
	Francisco chippies.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Oh. I see.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		For Cathy. For her birthday. By the 
		way, where is she?

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Across at Brinkmeyer's.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Miss Daniels is staying for the 
		weekend. In fact, I've already invited 
		her to dinner tonight.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	turning to him in surprise, beginning to shake her head.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>		After all, you did go to the trouble 
		of bringing up those birds.

<b>				MELANIE (O.S.)
</b>		I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>				LYDIA
</b>		You did say birds?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(understanding 
			completely now)
		Lovebirds, I see.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		...get away without thanking you in 
		some small way. After all, you haven't 
		even met Cathy and you are staying 
		for the weekend...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes, but...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		You are, aren't you?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Certainly, but...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Then it's settled. What time is 
		dinner, Mother?

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Seven o'clock, same as usual.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels.  
		Where are you staying?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		With... with Annie, of course.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter 
		to seven, will that be all right?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Annie... Annie may have made other 
		plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I 
		can find my own way.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		You're sure now? You won't hire a 
		boat or anything?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'm sure.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Seven o'clock then.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Maybe.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	grinning.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		We'll be waiting. How's your head 
		now?

<b>	MED. SHOT - THE GROUP
</b>
	Lydia looks at Mitch inquiringly.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(with an overwarm 
			smile)
		It's nothing, Mrs. Brenner. A gull 
		hit me, that's all.

	Lydia stares at her doubtfully.

<b>	EXT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S HOUSE - FULL SHOT
</b>
	Melanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her 
	hands. She rings the doorbell. The ROOM TO LET sign is still 
	in the window. The door suddenly opens.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(surprised)
		Oh, hi!
			(pause)
		Did you find her all right?

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
</b>
<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes, I did.

	There is a long awkward pause. Annie smiles expectantly at 
	Melanie. Melanie seems hesitant.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I was wondering...

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Yes?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		That sign.
			(pause)
		Do you think I could have the room 
		for a single night?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Well, I'd really hope to rent it 
		for...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I would appreciate it. I've tried 
		everywhere in town, and they're all 
		full.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(after a pause)
		Sure. You can have it.
			(smiles)
		Where's your bag? In the car?

	Melanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then 
	smiles.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		It's utilitarian, I'll say that for 
		it.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(smiling)
		I just picked up some things for the 
		night at the general store. You see, 
		I hadn't planned on spending much 
		time here.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Yes, I know. Did something unexpected 
		crop up?

	There is a moment where both women look at each other...  
	When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she 
	is again telling Annie to mind her own business.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes.
			(pause)
		May I use your phone? I'd like to 
		call home.

	There is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's 
	attitude, and then accepts it. She suddenly smiles warmly.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Why don't you come in then?  I was 
		just about to mix a martini.

	She is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both 
	hear a SOUND overhead. They turn to look skyward.

<b>	LONG SHOT - A FLOCK OF LARGE BIRDS
</b>
	flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky.

<b>	TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE
</b>
<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(shaking her head)
		Don't they ever stop migrating?

	But Melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously 
	serious expression.

</b>
	LONG SHOT - THE APPROACH ROAD to the Brenner house. Melanie's 
	car is driving along the shore. Behind her, the sky is stained 
	with sunset. There are gulls on the bay, cawing into the 
	silence.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CAR
</b>
	as it pulls into the Brenner yard.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	reaching up for the rear view mirror, tilting it to examine 
	her lipstick, touching the edge of her mouth with one hand.  
	She gets out of the car, CAMERA FOLLOWING her to the house.  
	She climbs the porch steps, KNOCKS on the door. There is no 
	answer. Puzzled, she begins walking back into the yard. In 
	the distance, she sees Mitch, Lydia and Cathy coming from 
	behind the chicken sheds. She raises her arm in greeting.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(calling)
		Hi!

<b>	FULL SHOT - MITCH, CATHY, LYDIA
</b>
	in the distance. Mitch and Cathy raise their arms.

<b>				CATHY
</b>			(excitedly)
		Hi!
			(she breaks into a 
			trot toward Melanie)

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she approaches. She is an eleven-year-
	old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt 
	and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head. She hesitates 
	for just a moment.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Miss Daniels?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes?

	And Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking 
	her off her feet, hugging her fiercely.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		They're beautiful! They're just what 
		I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? 
		I can't tell which is which.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Well, I suppose...

<b>	FULL SHOT - ALL OF THEM
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>			(coming up)
		Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm 
		glad you came. Are you hungry?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Famished.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Dinner's just about ready.
			(explaining)
		We were out back looking at the 
		chickens. Something seems to be wrong 
		with them.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(going toward house)
		There's nothing wrong with those 
		chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call 
		Fred Brinkmeyer right now.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(as they follow into 
			house)
		I don't know what good that'll do.
			(aside to Melanie)
		Chickens won't eat.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE
</b>
	as they ENTER, CAMERA FOLLOWING them throughout into dining 
	room where Lydia dials phone, talking to Mitch all along.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		He sold the feed to me, didn't he?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer 
		beware.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Whose side are you on?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I'm simply quoting the law.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Never mind the law. Cathy, you can 
		start serving the soup.

	She has finished dialing now, is waiting while the phone 
<b>	RINGS.
</b>
<b>				LYDIA
</b>		This won't take a minute, Miss Dan...
			(into phone)
		Hello, Fred? This is Lydia Brenner.  
		I didn't interrupt your dinner, did 
<b>		I?
</b>			(pause)
		Fred, that feed you sold me is no 
		good.
			(pause)
		The chicken feed. The three bags I 
		brought.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
	holding the telephone.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Well, it's just no good. The chickens 
		won't eat it.
			(pause)
		They're always hungry, Fred. I opened 
		one of the sacks when I got home, 
		and I poured it out for them, and 
		they wouldn't touch it. Now you know 
		chickens as well as I do, and when 
		they won't eat, there's just something 
		wrong with what they're being fed, 
		that's all.
			(pause)
		No, they're not fussy chickens.
			(pause)
		Who? What's he got to do with it?
			(pause)
		Fred, I don't care how much feed you 
		sold him. My chickens...
			(pause)
		He did? Dan Fawcett?
			(pause)
		This afternoon?
			(pause)
		Well, that only proves what I'm 
		saying. The feed you sold us is...
			(pause)
		Oh. Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  Uh-
		huh. Maybe I ought to go over to see 
		him. You don't think there's something 
		going around, do you?
			(pause)
		No, never.
			(pause)
		No, Fred, they don't seem sick at 
		all. They just won't eat.
			(pause)
		Mmmm. Mmmmm. Well, I'll try to get 
		over to Dan's farm.  Maybe he'll... 
		mmmmm... mmmmm... all right, Fred, 
		thanks.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM

	opposite each other in the center chairs. Cathy is serving 
	the last bowl of soup.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(as she sits)
		He got a call from Dan Fawcett a 
		little while ago. His chickens won't 
		eat, either.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		It's what you said, Mom. Mr.  
		Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(slowly)
		No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a 
		different brand.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	The meal is over. The lovebirds in their hanging cage have 
	been covered for the night. In the b.g. Mitch and Lydia are 
	carrying the stacked dishes to the kitchen. In the f.g.  
	Cathy and Melanie are by a small upright piano. Melanie is 
	playing a Debussy Arabesque: She picks up a cigarette from 
	the ashtray now and again to take a puff.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		I still don't understand how you 
		knew I wanted lovebirds.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Your brother told me.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(as she goes into 
			kitchen)
		Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, 
		is that right?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No, not exactly.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Mitch knows lots of people in San 
		Francisco. Of course, they're mostly 
		hoods.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(from the kitchen)
		Cathy!

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Well, Mom, he's the first to admit 
		it.
			(to Melanie)
		He spends half his day in the 
		detention cells at the Hall of 
		Justice.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(coming from kitchen)
		In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is 
		entitled to a fair trial. Your 
		brother's practice...

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Mom, please, I know all the democracy 
		jazz. They're still hoods.
			(to Melanie)
		He's got a client now who shot his 
		wife in the head six times. Six times, 
		can you imagine it?
			(she starts for living 
			room)
		I mean, even twice would be overdoing 
		it, don't you think?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(to Mitch as he carries 
			load of dishes out)
		Why did he shoot her?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		He was watching a ball game on 
		television.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		His wife changed the channel.

	He GOES INTO kitchen.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY
</b>
	Melanie interrupts her playing to take another puff at her 
	cigarette.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Is smoking fun?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Oh, I suppose so.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Could I have a puff?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I don't think your mother would like 
		that.

<b>				CATHY (O.S.)
</b>		Just a little one.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY
</b>
	They both glance conspiratorially toward the kitchen.  
	Quickly, Melanie extends the cigarette. Quickly, Cathy takes 
	a small puff.

<b>				CATHY
</b>			(delighted)
		Why, it's just like air, isn't it?
			(determined)
		When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like 
		a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, 
		you know.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I know.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Are you coming to my party?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I don't think so.
			(seeing the child's 
			face)
		I have to get back to San Francisco.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Don't you like us?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(touching her hair)
		Darling, of course I do!

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Don't you like Bodega Bay?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I don't know yet.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Mitch likes it very much. He comes 
		up every weekend, you know, even 
		though he has his own apartment in 
		the city. He says San Francisco is 
		just an ant hill at the foot of a 
		bridge.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(smiling)
		I guess it does get a little hectic 
		at times.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		If you do decide to come, don't say 
		I told you about it. It's supposed 
		to be a surprise party.

	Melanie laughs.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		You see, they've got this whole 
		complicated thing figured out where 
		I'm going over to Michele's for the 
		afternoon, and Michele's mother is 
		going to say she has a headache and 
		would I mind very much if she took 
		me home. Then, when we get back here, 
		all of the kids'll jump out!

		Won't you come? Won't you please 
		come?

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	Mitch is helping her as she loads the dishwasher.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		She's a charming girl, isn't she, 
		Mitch?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Yes, very.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		And certainly pretty.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Yes.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		How long have you known her?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I told you. We met yesterday.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		In a bird shop.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Yes.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		She was selling birds.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		No. I only led her into believing I 
		believed she was... Mother, it's 
		really very complicated.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		But she did buy the lovebirds and 
		then brought them all the way...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Mother, where did you go to law 
		school?

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(laughing)
		Forgive me. I suppose I'm just 
		naturally curious about a girl like 
		that.
			(pause)
		She's very rich, isn't she?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I suppose so. Her father owns a big 
		newspaper in San Francisco.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		You'd think he could manage to keep 
		her name out of print. She's always 
		mentioned in the columns, Mitch.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I know, Mother.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		She is the one who jumped into that 
		fountain in Rome last summer, isn't 
		she?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Yes, Mother.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.
			(pause)
		I know it was supposed to be very 
		warm there, Mitch, but... well...  
		actually... well, the newspaper said 
		she was naked.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I know, Mother.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		It's none of my business, of course, 
		but when you bring a girl like that 
		to...

<b>				MITCH

<b>				MELANIE

		Maybe we could go swimming or

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		In case you're interested, I was 
		pushed into that fountain.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Without any clothes on?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		With all my clothes on!  The newspaper 
		that ran the story happens to be a 
		rival of my father's paper.  Anything

<b>				MITCH
</b>		You were just a poor, innocent victim 
		of circumstance, huh?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'm neither poor nor innocent, but 
		the truth of that particular...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		The truth is you were running around 
		with a pretty wild crowd...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes, but...

		or convention or...

</b>		Yes.

		that the truth?

<b>				MELANIE

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		You were lying.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes, I was lying.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Did you really write a letter to me?  
		Or was that a lie, too?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I wrote the letter.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		What did it say?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think 
		you need those lovebirds, after all.

		That's what it said.

	suddenly, turns up his collar, and heads for the house.

</b>
<b>	INT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT - ANNIE
</b>
<b>	HAYWORTH
</b>
	In an easy chair, reading. She is wearing a robe and smoking, 
	absorbed in her book. She turns when she hears the front 
<b>	DOOR OPENING.
</b>
<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Miss Daniels? Is that you?

<b>				MELANIE (O.S.)
</b>		Yes.

	Annie rises to greet her. As Melanie ENTERS THE SHOT:

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Hi.
			(seeing her face)
		Is something wrong? Is that cut 
		beginning to bother you?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(touching her head)
		No, it's not the cut that's bothering 
		me.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(concerned)
		Would you like some brandy?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		If you have some, I'd...

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels.  
		Do you want a sweater or something?  
		A quilt?

	As Annie gets the brandy:

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No, thank you.
			(pause)
		Won't you call me Melanie?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		All right.
			(she smiles)

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE sitting, tucking her legs up under her. 
	She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact, 
	by the way this entire trip has worked out. Annie brings her 
	the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(sitting opposite her)
		It gets a little chilly here at night 
		sometimes. Especially if you're over 
		near the bay.

	Melanie nods and sips at the brandy. There is a long pause.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Well, how'd your evening go?

	Melanie shrugs.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Did you meet Lydia?

	Melanie nods.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Or would you rather I changed the 
		subject?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(with a tired smile)
		I think so.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(nodding)
		How do you like our little hamlet?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I despise it.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(laughing)
		Well, I don't suppose it offers much 
		to the casual visitor. Unless you're 
		thrilled by a collection of shacks 
		on a hillside. It takes a while to 
		get used to.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Where are you from originally, Annie?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		San Francisco.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		How'd you happen to come here?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Oh, someone invited me up for the 
		weekend a long time ago.

	There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Look, I see no reason for being coy 
		about this. It was Mitch Brenner.

	Melanie nods.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		I guess you knew that, anyway.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I suspected as much.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		You needn't worry. It's over and 
		done with. A long time ago.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Annie -- there's nothing between 
		Mitch and me.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Isn't there?
			(she shrugs)
		Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's 
		never anything between Mitch and any 
		girl.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What do you mean?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		I think I'll have some of that, too.
			(she pours brandy, 
			drinks, sighs)
		I was seeing quite a lot of him in 
		San Francisco, you know.
			(she smiles weakly)
		And then, one weekend, he asked me 
		up to meet Lydia.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		When was this?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Four years ago. Of course, that was 
		shortly after his father died.  Things 
		may be different now.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Different?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		With Lydia.
			(pause)
		Did she seem a trifle distant?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(smiling)
		A trifle.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Then maybe it isn't different at 
		all. You know, her attitude nearly 
		drove me crazy. I simply couldn't 
		understand it.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		When I got back to San Francisco I 
		spent days trying to figure out just 
		what I'd done to displease her.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		And what had you done?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Nothing! I simply existed. So what 
		was the answer? A jealous woman, 
		right? A clinging possessive mother.
			(she shakes her head)
		Wrong. With all due respect to 
		Oedipus, I don't think that was the 
		case at all.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Then what was it?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Lydia liked me, you see. That was 
		the strange part of it. In fact, now 
		that I'm no longer a threat, we're 
		very good friends.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Then why did she object to you?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Because she was afraid.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Afraid you'd take Mitch?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Afraid I'd give Mitch.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I don't understand.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch 
		the only thing Lydia can give him --
		love.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Annie, that adds up to a jealous, 
		possessive woman.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		No, I don't think so. She's not afraid 
		of losing her son, you see.  She's 
		only afraid of being abandoned.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Someone ought to tell her she'd be 
		gaining a daughter.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		She already has a daughter.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What about Mitch? Didn't he have 
		anything to say about this?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(apologetically)
		I can understand his position. He 
		went through a lot with Lydia after 
		his father died. He didn't want to 
		risk going through it all over again.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I see.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		So it ended. Not immediately, of 
		course. I went back to San Francisco, 
		and I still saw Mitch every now and 
		then... but we both knew it was 
		finished.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Then what are you doing here in Bodega 
		Bay?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		You get straight to the point, don't 
		you?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'm sorry. Forgive me.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		No, that's all right, I don't mind.  
		I came up here for two reasons. To 
		begin with, I was bored with my job 
		in San Francisco. I was teaching at 
		a private school there... well, you 
		know, you probably went to one 
		yourself.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I did.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Then you know. Little girls in brown 
		beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. 
		I'll go into that classroom on Monday 
		morning, and I'll look out at twenty-
		five upturned little faces, and each 
		of them will be saying, 'Yes, please 
		give me what you have.'
			(pause)
		And I'll give them what I have. I 
		haven't got very much, but I'll give 
		them every ounce of it. To me, that's 
		very important. It makes me want to 
		stay alive for a long long time.
			(she sighs)
		That's the first reason.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		And the second?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(simply)
		I wanted to be near Mitch.
			(pause)
		It was over, and I knew it, but I 
		wanted to be near him, anyway.
			(she smiles)
		You see, I still like him a hell of 
		a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't 
		want to lose his friendship... ever.

	There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE 
	shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer 
	it.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
</b>
	at the phone.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Hello?  Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't 
		asleep. What is it?
			(pause)
		Yes, just a little while ago. Sure, 
		hold on.
			(she turns to Melanie)
		It's Mitch. For you.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
</b>
	as they stare at each other across the room, Melanie 
	hesitating.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		He's waiting.

	Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie 
	to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her 
	throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie 
	talks to Mitch in the background.

	Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a 
	wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally 
	and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(at phone; coolly)
		Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, 
		thank you. No, no trouble at all.  I 
		simply followed the road. It's a 
		very bright night.
			(pause)
		What?  Oh. Well, there's no need to 
		apologize. I can understand...
			(pause; she listens)
		Well...
			(she listens again)
		That's very kind of you. No, I'm not 
		angry.
			(she listens)
		I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get 
		back to San Francisco.
			(pause)
		No, I wouldn't want to disappoint 
		Cathy, but...
			(pause)
		I see.
			(she is warming)
		I see. Well, if you really...
			(pause)
		All right. Yes, I'll be there.
			(pause)
		Good night, Mitch.

	She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		He wants me to go to Cathy's party 
		tomorrow afternoon.
			(pause)
		I said I would.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		I'll be going, too, to help out. It 
		should be fun, Melanie.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		It seems so pointless.
			(she sighs)
		I think I'll go to sleep. This has 
		been a busy day.
			(picking up her paper 
			bag)
		My luggage.

	She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Pretty. Did you get that at 
		Brinkmeyer's?

	Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent 
	for a moment, pensive. Then:

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Do you think I should go?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		That's up to you.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(firmly)
		Yes.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Then go.

	The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Thank you, Annie.

	Suddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, 
	startling them both.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(rising)
		Who can that be at this hour?
			(she walks to door)
		Who is it?
			(no answer)
		Is someone there?

	Melanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks 
	the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night.  
	There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(to the emptiness 
			outside)
		Is anyone there?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(pointing to the ground)
		Look.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL
</b>
<b>	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
</b>
<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(sympathetically)
		Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably 
		lost his way in the dark.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	who stares at the dead bird as Annie stoops to pick it up.  
	And then, slowly:

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		But... it isn't dark, Annie.  There's 
		a full moon.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
</b>
	as Annie, stooping, looks up at her. On their puzzlement and 
	consternation:

<b>							  FADE OUT
</b>
<b>	FADE IN
</b>
	HIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with 
	balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn. 
	The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are 
	clustered around a long folding table upon which are 
	sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either 
	helping the children to more or telling them they are having 
	too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and 
	LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, 
	are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and 
	away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin 
	bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the 
	entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background. 
	The CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more, 
	the party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the 
	CAMERA out to the left.

<b>	CLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNES
</b>
	Melanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and 
	stand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one 
	of his pockets, and two glasses from the other. He hands one 
	of the glasses to Melanie, and then pours.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I really shouldn't have any more.  
		I'm a little tipsy already.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I'm trying to get you to stay for 
		dinner. We're going to have a lot of 
		roast left over.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I couldn't possibly. I have to get 
		back.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(with a shrug)
		Cheers.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Cheers.

	They drink.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Why do you have to rush off? What's 
		so important in San Francisco?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Well... I have to get to work tomorrow 
		morning, for one thing.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(surprised)
		You have a job?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(sipping at the martini)
		I have several jobs.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		What do you do?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I do different things on different 
		days.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Like what?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(hesitating)
		On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work 
		for the Travelers' Aid. At the 
		airport.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Helping travelers.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes.

	She hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really 
	considered before what she does with her time, and now that 
	she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and 
	unimportant.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		And on Tuesdays, I take a course in 
		General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's 
		not a job, of course. I just take it 
		because...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		What about Thursdays and Fridays?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		On Thursdays I have my meeting and 
		lunch.
			(pause)
		I'm chairman of a group that's sending 
		a little Korean boy through school.  
		We plan how to raise funds and... 
		things like that.
			(she shrugs)

<b>				MITCH
</b>		And Fridays? What do you do then?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Nothing.
			(she smiles)
		I go to bird shops on Fridays.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I'm glad you do.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Do you know what I was doing in that 
		shop?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		What?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. 
		She's seventy years old, and veddy 
		prim and strait-laced.
			(she does an imitation)
		She's coming back from Europe at the 
		end of the month, and I'm going to 
		give her a myna bird that'll talk to 
		her.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		What'll it say?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(facetiously)
		You'll think me very bold, sir.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		No, tell me.

	She leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out 
	LAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into 
	Melanie's face.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	serious, introspective.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		That's silly, isn't it?  Teaching a 
		bird to shock my aunt. That's just 
		silly and childish.
			(slight pause)
		Maybe I ought to go join the other 
		children.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	as she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where 
	the children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch 
	stares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse 
	of character, and then follows her down the dune. The children 
	are all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold 
	from Michele to Cathy.

<b>	CAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	The CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We 
	see Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by 
	way of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they 
	reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of 
	the dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS 
	OFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the 
	children. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from 
	Michele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back.  During 
	this, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes 
	of Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is 
	watching Mitch and Melanie.

<b>	MITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V.
</b>
<b>	MED. SHOT - ANNIE
</b>
	CAMERA MOVES A LITTLE to her left (CAMERA RIGHT). At this 
	moment, in the background, Lydia is emerging with the birthday 
	cake. The candles on it are unlit. Lydia immediately also 
	catches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat 
	as she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple. 
	During this we see Annie in the foreground sending Cathy 
	off.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		All right then, here we go.
			(she spins her)
		Once!
			(she spins her again)
		Twice!
			(she spins her again)
		Three! Go get 'em, Cathy!

	She says all this while still looking toward the couple. She 
	turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on 
	her face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as 
	though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees.  
	Suddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:

<b>				LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
</b>		Look! Look!

	Annie swings round and the CAMERA RUSHES INTO her face as 
	she looks up.

<b>	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S P.O.V.
</b>
	A gull is swooping down.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
</b>
	as she changes her tactics, stops dead, and then cautiously 
	reaches out in front of her at the air. The gull suddenly 
	swoops at her, hitting her shoulder. She whirls.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		No touching allowed!

	She almost falls.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE GULL
</b>
	seen from Cathy's position. He flies off, cycles and then 
	returns.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
</b>
	reacting to gull. She turns her head back to Cathy.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	reacting to the gull hitting Cathy. They start towards Cathy.

<b>	MED. SHOT - ANNIE
</b>
	with Cathy and the children around. The CAMERA PANS DOWN as 
	she ducks with two gulls swooping by.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
	hurriedly putting the cake onto the table. She rushes round 
	to the front of it.

<b>	FULL SHOT - ANNIE - LYDIA'S P.O.V.
</b>
	Annie rising from the ground. Cathy and the other children 
	are running in the background.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	She starts to run out CAMERA RIGHT.

<b>	MED. SHOT - LYDIA REACHES CATHY
</b>
	She pushes her to the ground as a gull attacks.

<b>	TWO SHOT - TWO MOTHERS
</b>
	as a gull swoops between them.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	coming out of the house with a broom.

<b>	TWO GULLS
</b>
	swooping down at the children's heads.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	swinging at gull and missing.

<b>	LONG SHOT - LITTLE BOY
</b>
	running toward bank. Gull swooping after him.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY
</b>
	falling forward against the bank as the gull smashes into 
	him.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	running to the injured boy, who is lying against the bank.

<b>	THREE SHOT - MELANIE, MITCH AND LITTLE BOY
</b>
	They look up.

<b>	LONG SHOT - THE GULLS
</b>
	against the sky, flying away in formation.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	about to swing with the broom again, but the birds are no 
	longer there. A puzzled look crosses his face. He turns to 
	Melanie.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Are you all right?

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(coming over)
		That's the darnest thing thing I've 
		ever seen in my life.

<b>	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
</b>
<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Are they gone?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		They're gone, Mother.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE LAWN
</b>
	as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the 
	cake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck 
	very close by without having injured anyone. All that 
	adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Well... well, is everyone all right?

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(with a small boy)
		I think he got a little scratch, 
		Mother.

<b>				GIRL #3
</b>		Did you see them? They were hawks!

<b>				GIRL #4
</b>		They were bigger than hawks!

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Children, they were only seagulls.

	And then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her, 
	and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before.

<b>	TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE
</b>
	as Annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent 
	meaningful glance.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>				CATHY
</b>		They must have been after the food, 
		Mother.

	They all turn toward the table.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		They didn't touch anything.

</b>			(trying to restore 
			order)
		Well, they're gone now, so... so 
		let's...
			(pause)
		Who was 'it?' You were 'it,' weren't 
		you, Cathy?

<b>				GIRL #2
</b>		Can I be 'it,' Miss Hayworth?

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	as Annie and the children begin the game behind them.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		You look a little shaken.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I... I am.
			(pause)
		Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, 
		is it? The gull yesterday when I was 
		in the boat, and the one last night 
		at Annie's, and now...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Last night? What do you mean?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		A gull smashed into Annie's front 
		door.
			(pause)
		Mitch... what's happening?

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(concerned)
		I don't know, Melanie.
			(pause)
		Look, do you have to go back to 
		Annie's?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No, I have my things in the car.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(gently)
		Then stay and have something to eat 
		before you start back. I'd feel a 
		lot better.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	She nods, and then looks up at the sky. Suddenly she shudders.

<b>							  DISSOLVE
</b>
<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HANDS - DINING ROOM INT. IN BACKGROUND 
</b>
	He is slicing the leftover roast beef.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	putting the meat onto plate, turning over his shoulder to 
	call into living room. The lovebirds in their cage are making 
	a terrible racket.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Do you want some mustard with this?

<b>				MELANIE (O.S.)
</b>		No, thank you.

<b>				CATHY
</b>			(coming from kitchen)
		Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		She said something about having to 
		get home to take a call from her 
		mother back East.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Take it into the living room, would 
		you, hon?

<b>				CATHY
</b>			(seeing the birds)
		What's the matter with them?

	Lydia turns from a side table, where she is cutting some 
	French bread.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		What's the matter with all the birds?

	She covers the cage. Under the cover, the birds are still 
	tweeting madly. Lydia stares at the covered cage for a moment, 
	and then signs heavily.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Hurry up with the rest, Mitch. I'm 
		sure Miss Daniels wants to get on 
		her way.

			cup, hands it to 
			Melanie)

	They are now all eating with plates on their knees - buffet 
	style.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll 
		come onto the freeway much earlier.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(picking up a cup)
		Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, 
		isn't it, Mitch?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that 
		traffic going back to San Francisco.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Did you put the cover on that cage, 
		Mom?

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Yes, I did.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Just listen to them!

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(to Melanie)
		Some cream?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'll get it.

	She reaches over for the cream pitcher. Her eye is caught by 
	something in the fireplace.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	looking curiously.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE
</b>
	a single swift is sitting on the hearth.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Mitch...

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE

	as dozens of swifts begin pouring from the opening.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	frightened now.

	hundreds of birds pouring into the room.

	shrieking in terror, dropping her coffee cup.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	full of birds, swooping, diving. Mitch runs to the door, 
	throws it open.

<b>				MITCH

		Get outside! Run!
			(he turns toward Lydia)

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA in terror, surrounded by birds.

<b>				MITCH (O.S.)
</b>		Mother!

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	wrenching the cloth from the coffee table, cups, coffee pot, 
	sugar bowl, creamer falling to the floor as he swings the 
	cloth at the birds.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
</b>
	covering her face.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	reaching for small fireplace broom.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
	shrieking as the birds dive at her face.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	realizing it's impossible to run. They must stay and fight.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(shouting)
		Cathy, get some matches!

<b>	MED. SHOT - CATHY
</b>
	running for the kitchen. Birds swooping after her.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	swinging the fireplace broom.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	rushing to the fireplace. He is almost knocked over by birds 
	coming out of the opening. He stuffs paper under the logs 
	already in place there.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
	She lets out a horrified scream. There are birds fluttering 
	in her hair, caught there.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	swinging the broom, covered with birds.

<b>	MED. SHOT - A PICTURE ON THE WALL
</b>
	(an enlargement of a photograph of Cathy, smiling.) As a 
	bird flutters against it.

<b>	MED. SHOT - CATHY
</b>
	running into the room, covering her face with bent arm, 
	rushing to Mitch with the box of matches.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	taking the matches. He lights one. A bird hits his arm. He 
	drops the match. He lights another one.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE MATCH
</b>
	falling onto the paper in the fireplace. It flickers for a 
	moment, then catches. Birds are still pouring out, past the 
	paper beginning to catch.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER WINDOW PANE
</b>
	as a bird crashes through it.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	rushing to Lydia, swinging the cloth at her head. She is 
	hysterics now, BABBLING. The SHRIEK of the birds is a wild 
	cacophony.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE FIRE
</b>
	blazing.

<b>	MED. SHOT - A BIRD
</b>
	swooping out of the fireplace, its wings aflame.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
</b>
	less birds in the air now, the single flaming bird flying 
	toward the drapes.

<b>	MED. SHOT - THE DRAPES
</b>
	as the flaming bird lands on them.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE DRAPES
</b>
	catching fire.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	swinging the broom wildly.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Mitch! The curtains!

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	turning, seeing, his eyes opening wide.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	ripping at the flaming curtain. He throws it to the floor, 
	begins stamping on it.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
</b>
<b>				CATHY
</b>		It's working! The fire's working!

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE
</b>
	only the blazing fire. No more birds entering.

<b>	MED. SHOT - THE WINDOWS
</b>
	birds bursting through the panes, leaving.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	as she beats away another bird.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - ONE OF THE BROKEN WINDOWS
</b>
	the birds leaving en masse now.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
</b>
	A shambles. Windows broken, furniture knocked over, pictures 
	askew, the floor covered with birds and broken glass. In a 
	corner of the room, Lydia crouches with her hands covering 
	her face, sobbing. The burnt curtain is still smoldering.  
	Mitch is covered with soot. Melanie puts down the broom 
	wearily. The attack is over.

<b>							  DISSOLVE
</b>
<b>	INT. BRENNER LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - A HAND
</b>
	reaching down to pick up a dead bird.

<b>	MED. SHOT - AL MALONE, THE DEPUTY
</b>
	a plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out 
	speeding tickets or warning drunks. He holds the bird on the 
	palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while.

<b>				MALONE
</b>		That's a chimney swift, all right.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>		We know what it is, Al.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
</b>
	Lydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs, still in shock.

<b>				MALONE
</b>		Well, these birds live in chimneys, 
		you know.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Not by the thousands.

<b>				MALONE
</b>		No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.
			(pause)
		Did you have a light burning or 
		something.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Yes, but the curtains were drawn.

<b>				MALONE
</b>		'Cause sometimes birds are attracted 
		by light, you know.
			(pause)
		Sure is a peculiar thing.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		What are we going to do about it, 
		Al?

<b>				MALONE
</b>		I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do 
		about what?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Well...
			(he feels a little 
			foolish)
		Well... these birds attacked us.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MALONE
</b>
	slight disbelief on his face.

<b>				MALONE
</b>		What's more likely, they got in the 
		room and was just panicked, that's 
		all.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>			(still a little 
			hesitant)
		All right, I'll grant you a bird'll 
		panic in an enclosed room. But, they 
		didn't just get in. They came in! 
		Right down that chimney.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE
</b>
<b>				MALONE
</b>			(trying to make sense 
			of this)
		My wife found a bird in the back 
		seat of her car once.

<b>				MALONE
</b>			(shrugs)
		Didn't know how he got in there.  
		Had a broken leg, turned out. Just 
		fluttering all around there.
			(he shrugs again)

<b>				MITCH
</b>		These birds were...

<b>				MALONE
</b>		What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is 
		these things happen sometimes, you 
		know? Ain't much we can do about it.
			(he shrugs)

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Tell him about the party.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		That's right. We had a party here 
		this afternoon for Cathy. Her 
		birthday.

<b>				MALONE
</b>		Oh, yeah, yeah.
			(he grins)
		How old is she now?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Eleven. In the middle of the party, 
		some gulls came down at the children. 
		And Miss Daniels was attacked by a 
		gull just yesterday after...

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MALONE
</b>
	considering this.

<b>				MALONE
</b>		Yeah.
			(thinking)
		Were the kids bothering them or 
		something? 'Cause sometimes they'll 
		do that, you know. If you make any 
		kind of disturbance near them, they'll 
		just come after you. I seen that 
		plenty of times myself.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MALONE AND LYDIA
</b>
<b>				LYDIA
</b>		The children were playing a game, 
		Al. Those gulls attacked without...

<b>				MALONE
</b>		Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty 
		strong word, don't you think? I mean, 
		birds just don't go around attacking 
		people without no reason, you know 
		what I mean? The kids just probably 
		scared them, that's all.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		These birds attacked!

<b>				MALONE
</b>			(nodding)
		Well, what would you like me to do, 
		Lydia? Put out a pick up and hold on 
		any suspicious birds in the area?
			(he smiles)
		Now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't 
		it?

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>		Does this room look silly?

<b>	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE
</b>
<b>				MALONE
</b>		No, you got quite a mess here, I'll 
		admit that.
			(pause)
		Maybe you oughta put some screening 
		on top of your chimney
			(pause)
		Seems a little pointless, though.  
		Freak accident like this wouldn't 
		happen again in a million years.
			(pause)
		You want some help cleaning up?

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	exasperated.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I can handle it myself.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
	giving a small moan.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'll take Cathy up to bed.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>		Are you staying?

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I think I should, don't you?

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
	observing, making no comment.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	putting her arm around Cathy's shoulders.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'll get my things from the car. Do 
		you want to walk with me, Cathy?

<b>	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE
</b>
	as Cathy and Melanie go out.

<b>				MALONE
</b>		Well, if there's anything else I can 
		do, Mitch...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.

<b>				MALONE
</b>		Goodnight, Lydia.

	No answer.

<b>				MALONE
</b>		Sure is peculiar, I got to say that 
		for it.

	He exits.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	It is silent. Mitch looks across at Lydia who sits as still 
	as a stone in her chair. The door closes gently on a note of 
	utter helplessness.

<b>							  FADE OUT
</b>
<b>	FADE IN
</b>
<b>	INT. BEDROOM IN BRENNER HOUSE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	Melanie has just gotten out of bed. She is wearing the rather 
	unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store.  Her 
	hair is loose. She wears no makeup. She is bent over a 
	lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom. She is 
	busily brushing her teeth. Her head half turns as she HEARS 
<b>	VOICES.
</b>
<b>	 
</b>
<b>				LYDIA'S VOICE
</b>		Mitch! Mitch! Mitch, I'm going to 
		drop Cathy off now.

<b>				MITCH'S VOICE
</b>		Okay.

<b>				LYDIA'S VOICE
</b>		I'll probably drive over to the 
		Fawcett farm. Do you need anything 
		in town?

<b>				MITCH'S VOICE
</b>		No.

	Melanie finished brushing her teeth. She goes to the window 
	and looks out. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of the pickup truck 
	starting.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE YARD BELOW - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
</b>
	as Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck 
	and climbs in. The truck moves out of the yard and down the 
	road. It turns the bend, and moves out of sight.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	turning from the window. She goes to the bedroom door, CAMERA 
	FOLLOWING. She opens the door.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Mitch?

	There is no answer.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Mitch?

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	coming down the steps from the attic room. The house is empty. 
	The CAMERA FOLLOWS her into the dining room, where she stops 
	at the cage of lovebirds, bends down to them with a smile on 
	her face.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS
</b>
	She smiles and pokes her finger into the cage. The birds 
	TWEET at her.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(imitating them)
		Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	leaving the cage. She walks to the sideboard upon which is 
	an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall.  
	She feels it with her hand. It is hot. She pours a cup, then 
	peers out of the side window.

<b>	LONG SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
</b>
	Mitch on the shore, working with a rake in his hands. A thin 
	column of smoke is climbing the sky.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	carrying the cup of coffee. She sets it down for a moment to 
	put on her fur coat, which is hanging on the hall stand. She 
	picks up the cup again, walks to the front door and EXITS.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	coming out of the house and into the garden, carrying the 
	cup of coffee. It is a beautiful day. She sips at her coffee 
	and then breathes deeply of the air.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - HER FACE
</b>
	fresh, rested. There is a contentment in her which we have 
	not seen before. She looks off toward the shore.

<b>	LONG SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	on the shore, working with the rake. The thin column of smoke 
	is climbing the sky.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	She turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the 
	end of the garden toward the shore. A wind is blowing off 
	the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the 
	sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs 
	as she walks. She stands there silhouetted against the sky 
	for a moment.

<b>	SLOW PAN
</b>
	as Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in 
	sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in 
	its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin 
	column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and 
	raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts 
	the rake down and begins walking toward the house.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	There is anticipation on her face now. She watches Mitch 
	coming toward her, her eyes glowing.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	closer to the house now.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	waiting, anticipating.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	He stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	as first surprised, and then puzzled. The back screen DOOR 
	CLATTERS shut off screen. A small hurt look crosses her face.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the 
	garden, sipping idly at her coffee. A screen DOOR CLATTERS 
	again. She turns.

	Mitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing 
	a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>		I wanted to change my shirt.

	Melanie is uncomprehending.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		It smelled of the fire.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(nodding)
		It's hard to believe anything at all 
		happened yesterday, isn't it? It's 
		so beautiful and still now.
			(pause; then sagely)
		I think I've got it all figured out, 
		by the way.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Really? Tell me about it.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(secretively)
		It's an uprising.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Of birds?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Certainly, of birds.

	Mitch grins.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		It all started several months ago 
		with a peasant sparrow up in the 
		hills, a malcontent. He went around 
		telling all the other sparrows that 
		human beings weren't fit to rule 
		this planet, preaching wherever anyone 
		would listen...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Growing a beard...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(delighted)
		Yes, of course, he had to have a 
		beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' 
		he kept saying, over and over...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		So they united.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows 
		out for kicks...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Well, they'll go along with anything.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Sure. But eventually, even the more 
		serious-minded birds began to listen.  
		"Why should humans rule?" they asked
		 themselves.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Hear!

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Why should we submit ourselves to 
		their domination?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Hear, hear!

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		And all the while, that sparrow was 
		getting in his little messages.  
		Birds of the world, unite!

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Take wing!

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		You have nothing to lose but your 
		feathers.

	They both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then 
	laugh again and finally are silent. The garden is deathly 
	still.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(attempting to be 
			serious)
		What it was, probably...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Mmm?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		They're probably hungry, that's all.  
		This was a bad summer. They eat 
		berries and... and nuts, you know, 
		and the hills are all burned out, so 
		they're probably searching for food 
		wherever they can get it.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		With my little sparrow leading team.

	She laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time.  
	Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror 
	story, they are becoming a little frightened.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		It's so damn quiet out there.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		It was like that yesterday.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		What do you mean?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		After the gulls attacked.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I hadn't thought of that.
			(pause)
		And then the swifts came.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		It makes you feel as if they're... 
		they're waiting or... resting... 
		or....

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(trying to make it 
			light again)
		No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. 
		Your sparrow is standing on a soap 
		box and...

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	her face dead serious.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>		...waving his little wings...

	His voice trails. His face becomes serious, too. Again, the 
	garden is silent.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	her face set and grim, her eyes serious, her words coming 
	slowly and with the chill of horror on them.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		They were angry, Mitch. They came 
		out of the chimney in fury.
			(pause)
		I had the feeling they wanted each 
		and every one of us dead.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	He takes her in his arms suddenly, to comfort her. She goes 
	to him longingly.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Melanie, Melanie...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'm frightened, Mitch.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		No, no...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'm frightened and confused and I... 
		I think I want to go back to San 
		Francisco where there are buildings 
		and... and concrete and...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Melanie...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		...everything I know.

	She looks up at him suddenly.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Oh damn it, why did you have to walk 
		into that shop?

	They kiss suddenly and fiercely. On their kiss,

	Lydia at the wheel, pulling into the Fawcett farm, the name

	Lydia gets out of the truck and walks to the front door. She 
	knocks. There is no answer.

	She comes down off the steps, the CAMERA FOLLOWING, back a

<b>	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	of feed lying against the fence.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	getting an idea.

</b>
	at breakneck speed, negotiating the severe curves on the

</b>
	behind the wheel, unmindful of anything but flight.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD - LYDIA'S POV
</b>
	through the windshield, blurring past. She turns the bend 
	leading to the house. For an instant, through the windshield, 
	there is a quick glimpse of Melanie and Mitch in embrace in 
	the garden. Then the tires shriek, and the truck turns and 
	barrels into the front yard.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	alarmed as he runs out of the garden and toward the truck 
	just as it jerks to a stop.

<b>	INT. BRENNER KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	at the kitchen stove, taking a kettle of tea from the burner.  
	She pours it into a cup, puts the cup on a tray already set 
	with sugar and creamer. She looks up as Mitch comes into the 
	kitchen.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>		That was Al on the phone. He wants 
		me to meet him out at the Fawcett 
		place. Says some detectives from 
		Santa Rosa'll be there in a little 
		while.
			(pause)
		Will you be all right here?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes. I was just taking her in some 
		tea.

	He goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses 
	her hair. But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to 
	him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Be careful. Please.

	She walks him to the door. At the door, they kiss -- a long, 
	full kiss.

<b>	FULL SHOT -- THE KITCHEN
</b>
	as Mitch goes out. Melanie looks after him for a moment, and 
	then picks up the tray. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of his 
	car starting. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie out of the kitchen, 
	through the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on 
	the other side of the house. Gently, she KNOCKS.

<b>				LYDIA (O.S.)
</b>		Mitch?

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE BEDROOM
</b>
	This is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a 
	life no longer valid.  There are photographs of her dead 
	husband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of 
	Mitch's childhood. Under it all, there is a distinct 
	femininity. She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing 
	the tray.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought 
		you might like some tea.

<b>	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE
</b>
<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Oh, thank you.

	There is a long silence as Melanie puts the tray on the bed, 
	arranges the pillows behind Lydia.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Where's Mitch?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Al Malone wanted him out at the 
		Fawcett farm.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Why? Didn't Al believe my story?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		He was calling from the farm, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Then he saw.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		He must have. He sent for the Santa 
		Rosa police.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		What good will they do?

	She sips at the tea. There is a long awkward pause. Melanie 
	walks to the window and looks out over the bay.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Do you think Cathy's all right?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What?

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Cathy. At the school.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	at the window, her face turned away from Lydia. Her expression 
	clearly shows that she doesn't know whether Cathy is all 
	right. But when she turns to Lydia, there is a comforting 
	smile on her face, and her voice is soothing.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes, I'm sure she's fine.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND LYDIA
</b>
<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Do I sound foolish to you?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.
			(she shudders)
		They have such big windows at the 
		school.
			(pause)
		All the windows were broken. In Dan's 
		bedroom. All the windows.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Try not to think of that, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		I wish I were a stronger person.  
		There is a long awkward silence. She 
		sips at her tea reflectively.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		I lost my husband four years ago, 
		you know.
			(pause)
		It's odd how you depend on someone 
		for strength, and then suddenly all 
		the strength is gone, and you're 
		alone.
			(pause)
		I'd love to relax some time. I'd 
		love to be able to sleep.
			(pause; the worried 
			look again)
		Do you think Cathy's all right?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Annie's there. She'll be all right.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		I'm not this way, you know. Not 
		usually. I don't fuss and fret over 
		my children.
			(pause)
		When Frank died...
			(pause)
		You see, he knew the children, he 
		really knew them. He had the knack 
		of being able to enter into their 
		world, of becoming a part of them.  
		That's a rare talent.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		I wish I could be that way.

	There is another silence. A curious thing is happening in 
	this room. Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her 
	husband's death, is discussing it with another person.  
	Curiously, the person is Melanie.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(honestly and simply)
		I miss him.
			(pause)
		You know, sometimes I wake up in the 
		morning, and I think 'I have to make 
		Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get 
		up and there's a... a very good reason 
		for getting out of bed until... until, 
		of course, I remember.
			(pause)
		I miss talking to him.
			(pause)
		Cathy's a child, you know, and 
		Mitch...
			(she shrugs a little 
			sadly)
		...Mitch has his own life.
			(pause)
		I'm glad he stayed here today. I 
		feel safer with him here.
			(she sighs deeply)

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Would you like to rest now, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		No.  No... don't go yet.
			(pause)
		I feel as if I... I don't understand 
		you. And I want so much to understand.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Why, Mrs. Brenner?

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Because my son is...
			(pause)
		My son seems to be fond of you.
			(pause)
		And I...
			(pause)
		I'm not quite sure how I feel about 
		it. I really don't know if I... like 
		you or not.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner?  
		You liking me?

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Yes, I think so. My son is important 
		to me. I want to like any girl he 
		chooses.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		And if you don't?

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(with a faint smile)
		Then I don't suppose it'll matter 
		much to anyone but me.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I think it might also matter to Mitch.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(shaking her head)
		Mitch has always done exactly what 
		he wanted to do.
			(pause)
		I'm not complaining. That's the mark 
		of a man.  But...
			(pause)
		You see, I... I wouldn't want to 
		be... be left alone. I don't think I 
		could bear being left alone.  I... 
		forgive me. This business with the 
		birds has me upset.  I... I don't 
		know what I'd do if Mitch weren't 
		here.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(going to the bed; 
			adjusting the pillow)
		Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(sighing)
		I wish I were stronger.
			(she pauses and looks 
			toward the window.)
		Do you think she's all right? Do you 
		think she's safe at the school?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Would you like me to go for her?

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		I couldn't ask you to.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I don't mind, really.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Would you? I'd feel so much better.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'll just clear up here, and then 
		dress.

	She picks up the tray and starts for the door.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Melanie?

	At the door, Melanie turns.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	Melanie is at the door to Annie's room now. She opens the 
	door and looks in.

	leading the children in song. She catches sight of Melanie 
	at the door. Melanie wiggles her fingers. Annie points to 
	her wristwatch indicating that she'll be finished in a few 
	minutes and motions for her to wait in the play-yard outside.  
	Melanie turns and starts down the corridor again.

	head and shoulders of Melanie as she sits smoking. There is 
	no sound except for the faint voices of the children singing 
	inside the schoolhouse. Melanie is puffing away at her 
	cigarette and occasionally glances in the direction of the 
	school. We hold on this shot of Melanie for a very long time 
	so that we are able to express her ignorance of what is going 
	on behind her with the crows. After a wait of about what 
	seems to be a half a minute or more, Melanie's attention is 
	drawn to something above her.

	even perhaps 250. This last crow settles down with the others.

	The children mutter for a moment, and then are still.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		All right now.

	She begins opening the play yard door. Suddenly, the door 
	from the corridor bursts open, and Melanie rushes wildly 
	INTO the room. She goes directly to Annie, shoves her out of 
	the way, and SLAMS shut the play yard door.

		here. These big windows... there's 
		no way to board them up.

	Annie gives a quick nod, understanding immediately.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
</b>
	Through the windows, we can see the waiting crows. One moves 
	restlessly into flight, then settles on the equipment again.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Quiet down, children! Quiet down!

	The children modulate into silence.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		Miss Daniels wants to see how we 
		conduct ourselves during a fire drill. 
		I'd like you to...

<b>				CHILDREN
</b>			(grumbling in Unison)
		A fire drill? This is our play period, 
		Miss Hayworth! Gee whiz!  Etc.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		I'd like you to show her how quiet 
		and obedient you can be.

	The children again fall silent.

<b>				ANNIE
</b>		We're going to go out of the school 
		now. Those of you who live nearby 
		can go directly home. I want the 
		rest of you to go down the hill, all 
		the way to the hotel. Do you 
		understand?

<b>				CHILDREN
</b>		All the way down the hill? Gee, Miss 
		Hayworth, we never... Home? Why do 
		we...?

<b>				ANNIE
</b>			(shushing them)
		I want you to go as quietly as you 
		can, not a sound, until I tell you 
		to run. And then I want you to run 
		as fast as you can. Does everyone 
		understand?
			(pause - silence)
		All right. John, would you lead the 
		class, please?

	The children walk two-by-two to the corridor door. John opens 
	it, and they begin filing out. Melanie turns to look at the 
	play yard.

	wife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables. A 
	DRUNK sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of 
	booze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in 
	his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and 
	efficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another 
	table, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing 
	and clowning around throughout following at a table in the 
	rear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the 
	counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens.  
	Over her head, the television set is blasting with its 
	perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Daddy, there were hundreds of them.  
		No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying 
		to tell you this as calmly as I know 
		how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy.
			(she takes a deep 
			breath)
		Just now.  Not... fifteen minutes 
		ago.

	The door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wearing 
	walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking 
	woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through 
	foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what 
	Melanie is saying.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		At the school. No, I don't. Just a 
		minute.
			(to Deke)
		What's the name of the school?

<b>				DEKE
</b>		Just the Bodega Bay School.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Help you, Mrs. Bundy?

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		I need some change, Mr. Carter.

	As Deke opens cash register...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		The Bodega Bay School.
			(to Deke)
		Could you turn that down, please?

	Deke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I don't know how many children.
		Thirty or forty. Yes.

	Mrs. Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to 
	Melanie.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No, the birds didn't attack until 
		the children were outside the school. 
		Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. 
		Is there a difference between crows 
		and blackbirds?

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>			(turning from machine)
		There is very definitely a difference, 
		Miss.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		They're different, Daddy.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Thank you.
			(into phone)
		I think these were crows. Yes, 
		hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked 
		the children, attacked them.
			(exasperated)
		Daddy, a little girl was sent to the 
		hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all 
		right, but you act as if I'm... all 
		right, all right.
			(pause)
		No, I can't come home now. I just 
		can't, Daddy. How is it there? I 
		mean... are there birds? In the sky?  
		But no trouble. Well, I hope...
			(pause)
		I don't know when. I simply can't 
		leave now. Tell Mother not to worry.  
		All right, Daddy, good-by.

	She hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		They're both perching birds, of 
		course, but of quite different 
		species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. 
		The blackbird is cyanocephalus.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Thank you.
			(to Deke)
		Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?

<b>				DEKE
</b>		In the book right here, Miss.

	As Melanie looks it up...

<b>				DEKE
</b>			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		I don't see what difference it makes, 
		Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If 
		they attacked the school, that's 
		pretty serious.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>			(with a superior smile)
		I hardly think either species would 
		have the intelligence to launch a 
		massed attack. Their brain pans aren't 
		large enough for such...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(dialing)
		I just came from the school, madam.  
		I don't know about their brain pans 
		but...

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Birds are not aggressive creatures, 
		Miss. They bring beauty to the world. 
		It is mankind, rather, who...

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(going to door leading 
			to kitchen)
		Three Southern fried chicken, Sam.  
		Baked potato on all of them.

	LAUGHTER from salesman at table.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(into phone)
		Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, 
		please?
			(pause)
		Yes, I'll wait.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>			(continuing to Deke)
		...insist on making it difficult for 
		life to survive on this planet. If 
		it weren't for birds...

<b>				DEKE
</b>		Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to 
		understand. This young lady says 
		there was an attack on the school.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Impossible.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(in background)
		Mitch? I'm glad I caught you.  
		Something terrible has happened.

	Her background conversation continues through following:

<b>				DRUNK
</b>			(suddenly)
		It's the end of the world!

<b>				HELEN
</b>		What's this about the school?

<b>				DEKE
</b>		Bunch of crows attacked the school, 
		Helen.

<b>				DRUNK
</b>		It's the end of the world.
			(suddenly quoting)
		"Thus saith the Lord God to the 
		mountains, and to the hills, to the 
		rivers and to the valleys; Behold, 
		I, even I, will bring a sword upon 
		you, and I will destroy your high 
		places.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		The Lord's not destroying anything, 
		Jason.

<b>				DRUNK
</b>		"In all your dwelling places, the 
		cities shall be laid waste, and the 
		high places shall be laid waste!"
			(he nods)
		Ezekiel, Chapter six.

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(quoting)
		"Woe unto them that rise up early in 
		the morning that they may follow 
		strong drink."

<b>				DRUNK
</b>			(nodding)
		Isaiah, Chapter 5. It's the end of 
		the world.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes, all right, I'll wait for you.  
		Good-by.
			(she hangs up)

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>			(laughing)
		I hardly think a few birds are going 
		to bring about the end of the world.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(turning to her)
		These weren't a few birds.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE WOMAN AND THE CHILDREN
</b>
	waiting for their lunch, listening to the conversation; 
	becoming very nervous.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>				DEKE
</b>		I didn't even know there were many 
		crows in Bodega Bay this time of 
		year.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		The crow is a permanent resident 
		throughout its range. In fact, during 
		our Christmas Count, we recorded...

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - SHOLES
</b>
	eating.

<b>				SHOLES
</b>			(suddenly, from his 
			table)
		How many gulls did you count, Mrs.  
		Bundy?

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are 
		several varieties.

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		The ones that've been raising the 
		devil with my fishing boats.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Probably herring gulls. They arrive 
		in November, you know, and don't 
		migrate North again until March or...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(leaping upon this)
		Have you had trouble with gulls?

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		One of my boats did last week.

<b>				DEKE
</b>			(making a connection)
		This young lady got hit by a gull 
		only Saturday.

<b>				SAM'S VOICE
</b>			(from kitchen)
		Pick up the chicken.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Now it's gulls. A minute ago, it was 
		crows.
			(she picks up tray, 
			shrugs, goes to table)
		Deke, I'm still waiting for those 
		Bloody Marys!

<b>				DEKE
</b>		Coming right up!

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN
</b>
	as Helen brings food. She is beginning to get really 
	frightened.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Could you ask them to lower their 
		voices, please? They're frightening 
		the children.

<b>				LITTLE GIRL
</b>		Timmy has a canary.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		That's nice. Are you Timmy?

<b>				LITTLE BOY
</b>		My cousin is Timmy.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>				SAM'S VOICE
</b>			(leaving table, coming 
			to bar)
		A whole flock of gulls nearby capsized 
		one of my boats.  Practically tore 
		of the skipper's arm.

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(coming back)
		You're scaring the kids. Keep it 
		low.

<b>				DEKE
</b>		You're scaring me, too. Are you trying 
		to say all these...
			(he shakes his head)
		That sounds impossible, Sebastian.

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		I'm only telling you what happened 
		to my boat.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		The gulls were after your fish, Mr.  
		Sholes. Really, let's be logical 
		about this.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What were the crows after at the 
		school?

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		What do you think they were after, 
		Miss...?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Daniels. I think they were after the 
		children.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		For what purpose?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		To...
			(she hesitates)
		To kill them.

	There is a long silence.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Why?

	Another silence.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I don't know why.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		I thought not. Birds have been on 
		this planet since archaeopteryx, 
		Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty 
		million years ago!

	A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait 
		all that time to start a... a war 
		against humanity?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No one called it a war!

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>		Scotch, light on the water.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying 
		as much.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Are you finished here, Sebastian?

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		Let me have some apple pie, Helen.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Who said anything about war? All I 
		said was that some gulls...

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(yelling to kitchen)
		One apple pie! You want more coffee?

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		No. ...came down on one of my boats.  
		They could have been after the fish, 
		just as you said.

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>		Your captain should have shot at 
		them.

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		What?

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>		Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most 
		birds are. If you ask me, we should 
		wipe them all out. World would be 
		better off without them.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>			(outraged)
		Birds?

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>		Yeah, birds. All they do is make a 
		mess of everything. Who needs them?

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		We need them.

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>		Not if they're starting a war.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		They are incapable of organized 
		warfare!

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Have you ever seen a jay protecting 
		a nest?

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		I have seen jays doing everything it 
		is conceivable for jays to do.  
		Ornithology happens to be my 
		avocation, Miss Daniels. You're 
		talking about preservation of the 
		species, a hen protecting her young.  
		There's a vast difference between...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Maybe they're all protecting the 
		species. Maybe they're tired of being 
		shot at and roasted in ovens and...

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Are you discussing gamebirds now?  
		All birds are not gamebirds, you 
		know.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I don't know anything about birds 
		except that they're attacking this 
		town.

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>		Then fight back. Get yourselves guns 
		and wipe them off the face of the 
		earth.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		That would hardly be possible.

<b>				DEKE
</b>		Why not, Mrs. Bundy?

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Because there are 8,650 species of 
		birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. 
		It's estimated that five billion, 
		seven hundred and fifty million birds 
		live in the United States alone. The 
		five continents of the world...

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>			(muttering)
		Kill them all. Get rid of them.  
		Messy animals.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		...probably contain more than a 
		hundred billion birds!

<b>				DRUNK
</b>		It's the end of the world!

<b>				DEKE
</b>		Well, we seem to have more than our 
		share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy.  
		Maybe this young lady's right.  Maybe 
		they've all gone crazy.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want 
		it at the table?

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		No. Here's fine.
			(he begins eating)

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?

<b>				DEKE
</b>		Coming.

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(angrily)
		Are we running a business here -- or 
		a bird sanctuary?

<b>				SHOLES
</b>			(beginning to change 
			his mind)
		Actually, those gulls must have been 
		after the fish.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Of course.

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		Makes a lot more sense than... well, 
		an attack.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Of course it does. If we believe 
		that birds are attacking, why... why 
		next we'll believe that grasshoppers 
		and cockroaches are capable of...

<b>				DRUNK
</b>		Cockroaches!  Urghh!

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN
</b>
	getting more and more anxious.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Hurry, children. Finish your lunch.

<b>				BOY
</b>		Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		Maybe we're all getting a little 
		carried away by this. Admittedly, a 
		few birds acted strangely. That's no 
		reason to believe...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		This isn't a few birds! I keep telling 
		you that! These are gulls and swifts 
		and crows and...

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Maybe! Is it impossible?

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Yes. I have never known birds of 
		different species to flock together.  
		The very concept is unimaginable.
			(laughing)
		Why if that happened, we wouldn't 
		have a chance. How could we possible 
		hope to fight them?

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		We couldn't. You're right, Mrs.  
		Bundy.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>			(calling from table)
		Excuse me, may I have a check, please?

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(concerned)
		Is everything all right, ma'am?

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Yes, I... I'm anxious to get on the 
		road.

<b>				SAM
</b>			(coming from kitchen)
		What's the matter? Something wrong 
		out here?

<b>				DEKE
</b>		Nothing's wrong.

<b>				SAM
</b>		All this shouting.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		We're fighting a war, Sam.

<b>				SAM
</b>		A war? Against who? Did the 
		Russians...?

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		Against birds.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>			(suddenly)
		I'm glad you all think this is so 
		amusing. You've frightened my children 
		half out of their wits.

<b>				BOY
</b>		I'm not scared, Mommy.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Keep quiet. If that young lady saw 
		an attack on the school, why won't 
		you believe her?

<b>				SAM
</b>		What attack? Who attacked the school?

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Birds did. Crows! And you're all 
		sitting around here debating! What 
		do you want them to do next? Crash 
		through that window?

<b>				LITTLE GIRL
</b>			(frightened by her 
			mother)
		Mommy!

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Quiet! Why don't you all get home?  
		Lock your doors and windows!
			(her hysteria rising)
		Put on your coats, children!
			(to Deke)
		What's the fastest road to San 
		Francisco?

<b>				DEKE
</b>		The freeway, ma'am.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Where do I get it?

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>		I'm going out that way, lady. You 
		can follow me.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Then let's go. Now!

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>		I haven't finished my drink.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>			(on edge of panic, 
			shouting at her 
			children)
		Put on your coats! Do you want to 
		get trapped here?

<b>				BOY
</b>		I can't find my scarf.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Look in your sleeve!

	The door opens. Mitch and Al Malone come in.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Melanie?

	At the far table, the salesman begin singing, rowdily.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(going to her)
		I got here as fast as I could.  
		Where's Cathy?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		At Annie's house. She's all right.

<b>				SAM
</b>		Al, why aren't you over there where 
		the attack was?

<b>				MALONE
</b>		Because I just got back from Dan 
		Fawcett's place, that's why.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		He was killed last night. By birds.

<b>				MALONE
</b>		Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know 
		that for a fact.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		What are the facts, Mr. Malone?

<b>				MALONE
</b>		Santa Rosa police think it was a 
		felony murder. They think a burglar 
		broke in and killed him.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Were the Santa Rosa police at your 
		school today?
			(impatiently, to 
			salesman)
		Are you coming?

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>		Take it easy, lady.
			(through window)
		There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.

<b>				DRUNK
</b>			(quoting)
		"Look at the birds of the air: they 
		do not sow or read, yet your heavenly 
		father feeds them."

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		I'll never feed another bird as long 
		as I live!

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>		Something like this happened in Santa 
		Cruz last year. The town was covered 
		with seagulls.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Can't you please finish your drink?

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		That's right, sir, I recall it. A 
		large flock of seagulls got lost in 
		a fog and headed in for the town, 
		where all the lights were.

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>		They made some mess, too, smashing 
		into houses and everything.
			(shaking his head)
		They always make a mess. We're better 
		off without them.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		The point is that no one seemed to 
		get upset about it. They were gone 
		the next morning, just as if nothing 
		at all had happened. Poor things.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		I'm leaving! Are you coming?

<b>				SALESMAN
</b>		All right, all right!
			(he downs his drink)
		Hope you figure this out, folks.

<b>				DRUNK
</b>		It's the end of the world.

	The Tides is silent for a moment.

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		Well, I'd better get back to the 
		cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?

<b>				DEKE
</b>		Let's see. Scallops and coffee...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Hold it just a minute, Sebastian.

	Sholes turns to him.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	his face very serious.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		No one ever said you were, Mitch.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(flatly)
		I think we're in trouble. I don't 
		know how or why this started, but I 
		know it's here and I know we'd be 
		crazy to ignore it.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>			(sarcastically)
		Ignore what? The bird war?

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(exploding)
		Yes, the bird war, the bird attack, 
		the bird plague, you can call it 
		what you want to, they're out there 
		massing someplace and they'll be 
		back, you can count on that!

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Ridiculous!

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Mrs. Bundy, why don't you go home 
		and polish your binoculars?

<b>				SAM
</b>		Go on, Mitch.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		If we don't do something now, if we 
		don't get Bodega Bay on the move...

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		Look, Mitch, even if this is true, 
		even if all the birds...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?

<b>				SHOLES
</b>			(after a long pause)
		No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't 
		see any reason for it.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		It's happening. Isn't that a good 
		enough reason?

<b>				SHOLES
</b>			(thoughtfully)
		I like Bodega Bay as well as any 
		man. If I thought...
			(he shakes his head)

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Then help me, Sebastian. You're an 
		important man in this town. If you'll 
		help, the rest will.

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		Help how? What do you want to do?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I'm not sure, but...

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		If you don't even know what you want 
		to do...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Listen to him, please.

<b>				SAM
</b>			(taking position beside 
			Melanie)
		You listen to him, Sebastian!

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I only know we've got to drive them 
		away from town -- before they drive 
		us away.

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		How?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Mrs. Bundy, you said something about 
		Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting 
		lost in the fog, and heading in for 
		the lights.

<b>				DEKE
</b>		We don't have any fog this time of 
		year, Mitch.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		We'll make our own fog.

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		How do you plan to do that?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		With smoke.

<b>				MALONE
</b>		There's an ordinance against burning 
		anything in this town, unless it's...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army 
		uses.

<b>				DEKE
</b>		What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad 
		as birds.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>		Birds are not bad!

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		How can we go on living here if we 
		blanket the town with smoke?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Can we go on living here otherwise?

	Pause. They are silent.

<b>				SAM
</b>			(slowly)
		It's worth a try, Sebastian.

	There is more silence as they all consider. And then suddenly:

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Look!

	They turn toward the window.

<b>	TIDES CAR PARK - FULL SHOT
</b>
	Viewed from the side window inside the Tides we see three or 
	four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of 
	the Tides Office. Two more swoop into the foreground of the 
	window and out to the left.

<b>				DEKE
</b>			(alarmed)
		Gulls!

<b>				MITCH
</b>		They're back!

<b>				SHOLES
</b>		They're only the usual... What are 
		you...

<b>	TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT
</b>
	The first gull reaches the gas station but misses the 
	attendant who is in the act of filling the car. The owner is 
	seen disappearing into the men's room.

<b>	INT. TIDES
</b>
	A quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the 
	Tides Restaurant.

<b>	TIDES TOWN - MED. SHOT
</b>
	A nearer view of the gas station. A second gull hits the man 
	on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and 
	then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out 
	and causing it to spill. The third and fourth gulls sweep 
	by.  The gas begins to flow away.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	inside the Tides. Mitch dashes toward the door -- Melanie 
	after him. Through the glass windows into the street we see 
	people dashing off to the right, in the direction of the gas 
	station. At the door, Mitch turns.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(to Melanie)
		Stay back in here.

	Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch.  
	They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at 
	the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the 
	window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to 
	rescue the attacked gas station attendant.

	Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter 
	away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in 
	the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks 
	down.

<b>	TIDES CAR PARK - MED. SHOT
</b>
	on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is 
	flowing to the right into the car park.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - GASOLINE
</b>
	flowing down to the car park.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	through the window. She suddenly looks toward the gas station.

<b>	MED. SHOT - THE CAMERA PANS
</b>
	along the flowing gas back to the station.

<b>	CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</b>
	She turns back to the car park.

<b>	FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT
</b>
	We see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked 
	below her. At this particular moment, a car has pulled up, 
	has come to a stop and a man emerges. He is in the act of 
	lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the 
	happenings around the gas station. With this half-drawn 
	attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar.

<b>	CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</b>
	She quickly slides the window open and yells down to the 
	man.

<b>	FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT
</b>
	The man looks about him, holding the match I his fingers. As 
	he catches sight of Melanie, the match burns his finger and 
	he drops it.

<b>	CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</b>
	Her horror-stricken face.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE PARKING AREA
</b>
	Three fast explosions in a row as the man's car, Mitch's 
	car, and the one next to it go up in flames.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE
</b>
<b>	TURNING TO SEE
</b>
<b>	FULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION
</b>
	The line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars, 
	following the gasoline on the ground, directly to the pump, 
	which blows up as the men are jumping away with the injured 
	attendant.

<b>	EXT. TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT
</b>
	A very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the 
	town rushing around the car park and the streets across the 
	highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see 
	automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil 
	smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the 
	parked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and 
	have trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the 
	foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill 
	with wheeling gulls. The whole picture below becomes 
	obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop 
	down on the town.

<b>	EXT. TIDES TOWN
</b>
	A raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone 
	booth and motel off in the background. People are rushing 
	out from the restaurant and look up in the sky. Gulls begin 
	to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the 
	restaurant. Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch:

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Mitch...! Mitch!

	We see her look up to the sky.

<b>	LONG SHOT - THE SKY
</b>
	The sky is full of seagulls.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	Looking about her frantically. She turns her face up again 
	to see the descending gulls. She is driven to take refuge in 
	the phone booth.

<b>	CLOSEUP - INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH - MELANIE
</b>
	slams the door shut. Gulls are now beating at the glass all 
	around her.

<b>	EXT. TIDES TOWN
</b>
	From Melanie's viewpoint inside the booth we see the people 
	who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with 
	clouds of birds coming on them.

<b>	CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</b>
	looking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her 
	eyes for Mitch.

<b>	MED. SHOT - PEOPLE RUSHING FROM THE TIDES
</b>
<b>	CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</b>
	in the phone booth. She turns and looks swiftly in the 
	direction of the car park.

<b>	EXT. TIDES CAR PARK
</b>
	Some men have secured a hose and are obviously getting water 
	from the bay. They are turning the stream onto the burning 
	cars. At this time, the birds are filling the area around 
	them. They suddenly turn the hose up into the birds.

<b>	CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</b>
	Her eyes turn up quickly.

<b>	LONG SHOT - FROM HER VIEWPOINT
</b>
	We see the stream of water swing to and from among the birds.  
	Melanie turns back from this at the sound of a roaring car.

<b>	EXT. TIDES TOWN - FROM HER VIEWPOINT
</b>
	We see a car zig zag down from the town in a drunken manner 
	coming toward her in the phone booth.  We can see birds flying 
	in and out of the windows of the car.  We can see the arm 
	and hand of the driver trying to beat them away. In the 
	background of this scene we see the fire truck arrive.

<b>	CLOSEUP - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE
</b>
	as the car comes toward her in the booth.

<b>	EXT. TIDES TOWN
</b>
	At the last minute, the car swerves away from the booth.

<b>	CLOSER SHOT
</b>
	A side view of the car after practically scraping the side 
	of the booth. We see that it's full of birds attacking the 
	driver. As it goes by, it near tilts over to inadvertently 
	give us a view of its interior.

<b>	FLASH CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</b>
	watching the car.

<b>	EXT. TIDES CAR PARK
</b>
	The car goes on and smashes into the other burning cars. It 
	explodes.

<b>	CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</b>
	Suddenly she hears the firing of a gun. She turns.

<b>	TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT
</b>
	She sees a man with a gun shooting up at birds but to no 
	avail. One or two descend upon him. He throws the gun down 
	and rushes back into the Tides Office. Melanie, with a slight 
	turn, now sees:

<b>	THE TIDES TOWN
</b>
	The fire volunteers with birds descending around them drop 
	their hose.

<b>	CLOSER SHOT
</b>
	shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping. At one moment the 
	water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows 
	of the phone booth.

<b>	CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</b>
	recoils from this water attack. Through the streaming window 
	she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. To the 
	left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its 
	palomino-colored body covered with crows. It is bucking and 
	leaping and kicking its van to pieces.

	At this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of 
	a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows.  
	His face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are 
	covered with attacking birds. He disappears from sight.  
	Melanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see Tides 
	Town. Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter, 
	the owner of the Tides, coming down toward the CAMERA and 
	waving the birds away from them with flailing arms.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of 
	recognition, but she has barely stepped out when more gulls 
	crash around the booth causing her to go back.

<b>	CLOSEUP - MELANIE IN PROFILE
</b>
	looking out again toward Mitch.

<b>	EXT. TIDES TOWN
</b>
	Through window she sees Deke Carter run off in one direction 
	while Mitch suddenly sees a child at the window of the burning 
	building adjacent to the flaming and smoking gas station. 
	Mitch dashes across and goes up the short staircase into the 
	smoking building.

<b>	CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</b>
	looking across in horror.

<b>	LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING
</b>
	For a moment there is no sign of anyone about, then suddenly 
	Mitch appears with the small child at the window. He calls 
	down. One man dashes from the direction of the Tides Office, 
	another from the Tides Restaurant. They both wait below the 
	window as Mitch drops the child.

<b>	FLASH - MELANIE
</b>
	watching this breathlessly.

<b>	CLOSER SHOT
</b>
	The moment the child has dropped, Mitch suddenly looks up.  
	He slams the window as two or three birds crash into the 
	windows. They disappear into the building.

<b>	CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</b>
	holding her breath.

<b>	LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING
</b>
	No sign of Mitch.

<b>	CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</b>
	getting more desperate.

<b>	CLOSEUP - BUILDING
</b>
	No sign of Mitch. Suddenly a chair flies through the window 
	and Mitch climbs OUT and drops to the ground.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	opening the door of the booth, yells out to him.

<b>	LONG SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	sees her and starts running toward the booth.

<b>	HIGH SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	beating his way through the birds. He reaches the booth.

<b>	LOW SHOT
</b>
	close to the Tides Restaurant entrance. We see Mitch drag 
	Melanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the 
	CAMERA through the birds into the restaurant.

<b>	INT. THE TIDES
</b>
	There must be at least twenty people all looking toward the 
	windows. It is as though they are hiding from a storm. The 
	CAMERA is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch COME IN, very 
	hurriedly close the door. We see the gulls wheeling outside.  
	There is a kind of stunned silence among the people. We can 
	hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside. Suddenly a 
	woman's voice SCREAMS out:

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Why are they doing it?! Why are they 
		doing it...?!

	Some of the heads of the group turn.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT
</b>
	It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs.  
	Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and 
	helpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some 
	words.

<b>				MRS. BUNDY
</b>			([Mrs. Bundy offers a 
			weak explanation of 
			why the birds could 
			have gone berserk 
			like this. This 
			information should 
			be obtained from Dr. 
			Stager.])

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	looking across at this slight scene. They turn back and over 
	their shoulders the gulls seem to be in much less quantity.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(looking up)
		I think they're going.

	Melanie follows his look. At this moment there is a loud 
	CRASH OF GLASS. They turn their heads suddenly.

<b>	MED. SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT
</b>
	And past the heads of the other people who have also turned, 
	we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has 
	gone and gulls are coming in. Two or three of the men who 
	are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the 
	window, beating them out. They succeed in doing this.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	They turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the 
	street.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I think it's safe to get out now.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Don't let's take any chances.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		We've got to get Cathy.

	They open the door and make their way out into the street, 
	running and looking about them desperately.

<b>	EXT. BODIGA STREET
</b>
	There are one or two gulls flying around. Others are perched 
	on roofs as we see Mitch and Melanie dashing along the 
	sidewalk.

<b>	EXT. BODIGA STREET
</b>
	There are still one or two gulls or crows in evidence as 
	they move along past the last street and come into the more 
	countrified part of the town.

<b>	LONG SHOT - THE SCHOOL YARD
</b>
	We see them turn and dash up the road toward the school which 
	we see in the distance. There are some birds perched on the 
	school roof.

<b>	SIDE-ON DOLLY SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	going up the school road. He stops for a moment and looks 
	up, Melanie following his look.

<b>	SKY SHOT - FULL
</b>
	of wheeling gulls.

<b>	SIDE-ON CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
</b>
	They move on and go past Melanie's waiting car outside the 
	school. Suddenly Melanie brings him to a halt.

<b>	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE - FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT
</b>
	There are a few blackbirds on it.

<b>				MELANIE'S VOICE
</b>		Look... the crows again.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
</b>
	Mitch starts off. Melanie restrains him.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Careful, Mitch. The crows may be 
		back in the play yard.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO
</b>
	They advance cautiously. When they are level with the play 
	yard, we see what they see.

<b>	MED. SHOT
</b>
	THE CAMERA DOLLIES along the play yard. It is again full of 
	crows.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT
</b>
	They walk stealthily past.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT
</b>
	CAMERA PANNING ALONG the waiting crows.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT
</b>
	Shooting over the shoulders of Melanie and Mitch, they 
	approach Annie's house. Melanie glances apprehensively over 
	her shoulder toward the crows.

<b>	EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE
</b>
	Melanie and Mitch arrive. They come to a sudden stop.

<b>	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE
</b>
	A woman is crumpled lifelessly on the front steps before the 
	door.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	He reaches the body. He rolls it over.

<b>	QUICK CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
</b>
	dead.

<b>	QUICK CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	The shock registering on his face.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	realizing that Annie is dead, and wondering for a moment 
	what Mitch's reaction will be.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
</b>
	He kneels silently by the body. Gently, he touches Annie's 
	face, and then gently and illogically takes off his jacket 
	and covers her, as if he is tucking a blanket around her to 
	keep her warm. He turns away then.

<b>	MED. SHOT - THE WINDOW
</b>
	with its ROOM TO LET sign. Cathy is standing near the sign, 
	with her eyes peering at something outside.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	turning to follow Cathy's gaze.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MIXED BIRDS
</b>
	Malevolent, sitting on the fence, the killers.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD
</b>
	As in fury, Mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at 
	the birds. Melanie dashes forward.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(as the birds flutter 
			into the air)
		Mitch! Don't!

	She runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he 
	maniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are 
	now hovering flight.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Please! Get Cathy!  Let's get out of 
		here!

	Her words reach him. Breathing heavily, he goes INTO the 
	house and COMES OUT carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a 
	state of shock. The CAMERA PANS him over to Melanie who holds 
	Cathy to her.

<b>	CLOSER THREE SHOT
</b>
	as Melanie looks anxiously toward the house.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Mitch, you can't leave her out there.

	He GOES OUT OF PICTURE. Melanie watches him. Over her shoulder 
	is the white face of Cathy. We HEAR a DRAGGING SOUND and 
	then a door is CLOSED.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
</b>
	We see Mitch EMERGING from the house. The body is no longer 
	in the pathway. He comes toward the CAMERA.

<b>	MED. SHOT
</b>
	He joins Melanie and Cathy. The CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of the 
	three of them as they silently make their way past the crows 
	once more, Melanie holding Cathy close to her. They look out 
	cautiously to the right.

<b>	MED. SHOT
</b>
	CAMERA DOLLYING PAST the crows again.

<b>	BACK TO THE DOLLY SHOT OF THE THREE
</b>
	They move forward stealthily, CAMERA AHEAD of them.

<b>	MED. SHOT
</b>
	Another DOLLY SHOT past the crows.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE
</b>
	The CAMERA is now behind them. They move away from us and go 
	toward the waiting car.

<b>	MED. SHOT
</b>
	They arrive at the car.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		You drive, Mitch.

	She goes round the far side and gets into the car. Mitch 
	slips in behind the driver's seat. The car turns into the 
	CAMERA and goes down the school road.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR
</b>
	Mitch, Cathy and Melanie facing the CAMERA, tensely. Melanie 
	looks over her shoulder.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(holding her breath)
		I don't think they're coming.

	Cathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes 
	wide, her lip trembling. They drive in silence, and then 
	suddenly, Cathy begins speaking, almost as if to herself, as 
	the CAMERA COMES IN TIGHT on her face in shock.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		On our way back from taking Michele 
		home... we... we heard the explosion 
		and went outside to... see what... 
		what it was.
			(pause)
		All at once the... the birds were 
		everywhere. All at once.  She... she 
		pushed me inside and... they covered 
		her.
			(pause)
		Annie.
			(pause)
		She pushed me inside.

<b>	TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE
</b>
	as she takes the child in her arms to comfort her.

<b>							  DISSOLVE
</b>
	CLOSE SHOT - A LONE GULL flying low over the water, the CAMERA 
	TRACKING it. The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings 
	to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues 
	low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting 
	there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, 
	not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the 
	Brenner house in the distance.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE
</b>
	Behind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed 
	across the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two 
	attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay.

<b>	LONG SHOT - THE BAY
</b>
	covered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is 
	still smoldering. But the sky is clear of birds.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	picking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where 
	the ladder leans against the side of the house.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE
</b>
	as Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner, 
	carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She 
	is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is 
	not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her 
	hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked 
	with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there 
	is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she 
	stands looking toward the distant smoldering town.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		The town looks clear.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		The bay doesn't.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		How long have they been gathering 
		there?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		The past fifteen minutes.
			(pause)
		It seems to be a pattern, doesn't 
		it? They strike and disappear, and 
		then they start massing again.

	Melanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I keep thinking of Annie.
			(she squeezes her 
			eyes shut)

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(after a long pause)
		It... it doesn't look very different, 
		does it? A little smoke over the 
		town, but otherwise...

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(looking)
		Even the birds sitting out there.  
		It does look very much the same, 
		Mitch. This could be last week.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		It may not be last week again for a 
		long long time.

	They are both silent.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Look. They're still coming.

	Mitch nods. Silence.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Do you want to try your father again?
			(Melanie shakes her 
			head.  Puzzled, Mitch 
			looks at her)

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I tried a little while ago. The 
		phone's dead.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Have we still got power?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Yes.
			(leaning against him)
		I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very 
		tired.

<b>				LYDIA (O.S.)
</b>		Mitch! I'm getting something on the 
		radio!

<b>	INT. THE LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT
</b>
	Lydia is hovering near the radio. Cathy is sitting on a 
	footstool. The windows are boarded, and the lights in the 
	room are on. A tremendous amount of static is coming from 
	the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		I can't get any of the local stations.  
		I think this is San Francisco.

<b>				ANNOUNCER
</b>		...would include formulation of a 
		central financing committee to handle 
		credit and to allocate responsibility 
		for the various facets of the project. 
		A vote on the motion is expected 
		early tomorrow morning.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	listening.

<b>				ANNOUNCER
</b>		Continuing with the local news, police 
		are still investigating the series 
		of valuable jade burglaries in the 
		Chinatown area. The round-up of known 
		criminals has not as yet produced a 
		suspect, but Commissioner Nelson 
		said today he was certain the 
		burglaries were quote linked and the 
		work of the team of professionals 
		unquote.
			(pause)
		In Bodega Bay early this morning, a 
		large flock of crows attacked a group 
		of children who were leaving the 
		school during a fire drill. One little 
		girl was seriously injured and taken 
		to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but 
		the majority of children reached 
		safety in the town.

		On the national scene today, the 
		opening of the new session of Congress 
		was marked by a State of the Union 
		address that...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Is that all?

<b>				ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
</b>		...drew a standing ovation for the 
		President. The Chief Executive, in 
		discussing our relation to Europe 
		and the rest of the world community 
		said: "These various elements of our 
		foreign policy lead as I have said 
		to a single goal --

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(sighing)
		We're going to need more wood for 
		the fire. We can't let it go out.

<b>				ANNOUNCER
</b>			(continuing as drone 
			in background)
		The goal of a peaceful world of free 
		and independent states.  This is our 
		guide for the present and our vision 
		for the future -- a free community 
		of nations, independent but 
		interdependent, uniting north and 
		south, east and west, in one great 
		family of man, outgrowing and 
		transcending the hates and fears 
		that rend our age.  We will not reach 
		that goal today or tomorrow.  We may 
		not reach it in our lifetime.  But 
		the quest is the great adventure of 
		our century.  We sometimes chafe at 
		the burdens of our obligations, the 
		complexity of our decisions, the 
		agony of our choices, but there is 
		no comfort or security for us in 
		evasion, no solution in abdication, 
		no relief in irresponsibility.
			(pause)
		In assuming the tasks of the 
		Presidency, I said that few 
		generations, in all history, had 
		been granted the role of being the 
		great defender of freedom in its 
		hour of maximum danger.  This is our 
		good fortune, and I welcome it now 
		as I did when I first took office.
			(pause)
		For it is the fate of this generation -- 
		Of you in the Congress and of me as 
		President -- to live with a struggle 
		we did not start, in a world we did -
		not make. But the pressures of life 
		are not always distributed by choice. 
		And while no nation has ever faced 
		such a challenge, no nation has ever 
		been ready to seize the burden and 
		the glory of...

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(pause)
		Did you you get the windows in the 
		attic, Mitch?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		 I got them all, Mother.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		When do you think they'll come?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I don't know.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		If there are... larger birds, Mitch... 
		they'll get into the house.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		That's a chance we have to take.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Maybe we ought to leave.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Not now.  Not while they're massing 
		out there.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		When? 

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I don't know when.  We'll see what...

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Where will we go?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I don't know yet.  I think we'll be 
		safe here.
			(Pause)
		Let's bring that wood in.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		What happens when we run out of wood?

	Music begins to play.  The music is sweet, with violins and 
	long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the 
	tension being played in front of it.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I don't know. We'll break up the 
		furni...

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(shouting)
		You don't know, you don't know!  
		When will you know? When we're all 
		dead? Like Annie?

<b>				CATHY

<b>	FULL SHOT - HOUSE

	as Melanie and Mitch come out and head for the pile of wood.  
	There is a NOISE in the sky. Startled, glancing upward, they 
	begin to run back toward the house and then stop and slowly 
	scan the sky.

<b>	FULL SHOT - ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Where are they heading?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Inland.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Santa Rosa?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Maybe.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	watching the birds. A look of utter sadness crosses her face. 
	It is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach Santa 
	Rosa, and eventually San Francisco as well.

<b>				MITCH (O.S.)
</b>			(gently)
		Come on. Let's get this wood in.

	Melanie nods. But the look of sadness stays on her face, and 
	her eyes remain on the sky.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM
</b>
	Lydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we 
	can HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the 
	sound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch.  
	There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights, 
	kerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace 
	putting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room 
	and dumps another load.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		That's the last of it.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Did you close the door?

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		And locked it.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(snapping it)
		No!

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Mom, they're in a cage!

</b>		They're birds!

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	studying his mother, realizing how close she is to breaking.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(softly)
		Let them stay in the other room.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
	her hand trembling as she pours the coffee.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
</b>
	as they all sit and accept their coffee. The room is silent 
	except for the CRACKLE of the fire. Mitch rises to put more 
	wood on the fire. In the dining room, the lovebirds still 
	are CHATTERING wildly. Their chirping is the only sound in 
	the house.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The 
		birds.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(putting wood on fire)
		I don't know, honey.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Why are they trying to kill people?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I wish I could say. But if I could 
		answer that, I could also tell you 
		why people are trying to kill people.

	The room is silent again except for the TWEETING of the 
	lovebirds offscreen. And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall 
	silent.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
</b>
	turning to look toward the other room, her face going white, 
	her eyes widening.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	waiting.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
	waiting.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	waiting.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
</b>
	dead silent now. Each of them is sitting on the edges of 
	their chairs, waiting. There is the SUDDEN SOUND of 
	splintering glass.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Mitch...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Shhh. Shhh.

	Silence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING, 
	the THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence.  More panes 
	of glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards 
	and the outside of the house begins building, almost like 
	muffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm. 
	Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, 
	is the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section 
	entering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the 
	roof.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
	looking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She 
	squeezes her eyes shut.

<b>	TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE
</b>
	as the child cuddles up into her arms. Over the other sounds, 
	there comes a NEW SOUND, the unmistakable rat-tat-tat-tattat

	of a woodpecker. It stops. It begins again. Rat-tat-tat tattat-
	tat. Tat-

<b>				CATHY
</b>			(in terror)
		I'm... I'm sick, Melanie. I want.. I 
		want to throw...

	Her face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'll go with you.

	They leave the room. Mitch and Lydia sit in silence. We HEAR 
	Cathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling 
	of wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of 
	birds striking the house.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM
</b>
	Mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the 
	birds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his 
	watch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back 
	door. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the 
	dining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS
</b>
	watching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes?  
	He cannot tell.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a 
	NEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing 
	sound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	coming into the entry hall.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR
</b>
	The wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside 
	assail the door.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	turning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining 
	room. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it 
	toward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and 
	piles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again, 
	CAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags 
	it to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table 
	when Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with 
	alarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is 
	and then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of 
	desperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The 
	CLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din 
	now, insidious and increasingly more frightening.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		When will they stop?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I thought they'd have stopped by 
		now.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		What time is it?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Almost two a.m.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		You must be exhausted.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		How about you?

	She shakes her head. They both move into the dining room, 
	the CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their 
	cage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready 
	to carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the 
	chair, goes to the cage.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	looking at the birds, wondering.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS
</b>
	looking back at him. Again, it is impossible to read their 
	expressions. Malice or benevolence?

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	He raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS
</b>
	watching, unmoving.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S FINGER
</b>
	as he thrusts it through the bars. The birds sit unmoving.  
	One of them tweets.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>		I wonder if Cathy fed them.

	He turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door, 
	takes out a small box of bird feed.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE
</b>
	as his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him.  
	His hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the 
	small catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door.  
	Cautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage.  
	The birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the 
	small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it 
	in the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then, 
	tweeting, they begin to eat.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM
</b>
	as Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped 
	against the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms.  
	Wearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling, 
	pecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(holding her)
		You should have left when you wanted 
		to.

	She shakes her head.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		You'd have been safe in San Francisco.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I don't want to be safe. I want to 
		be with you.

	There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like 
	a small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close, 
	Mitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand 
	in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of 
	night sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(in the darkness)
		The power.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Mitch...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Wait here. Don't move.

	The screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the 
	blackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the 
	SOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes 
	on.

<b>	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</b>
	as he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as 
	he directs the beam upwards.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		We'd better light some of those lamps.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		No... wait.
			(pause)
		Hold me.

	In the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. It is 
	almost black in the room except for the strange effect of 
	the flashlight as he holds it behind her.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I think they're easing off.

<b>							  DISSOLVE
</b>
<b>	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM
</b>
	A kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the 
	fire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep 
	on the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs.  
	Mitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly 
	and steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer 
	the sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another 
	SOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a 
	steady dribbling, difficult to place.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	listening to the curious sound, trying to fathom its meaning.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(whispering)
		Mitch?

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	as she turns toward him.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(still whispering)
		Mitch?

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	asleep.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	seeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming 
	from somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep, 
	picks up a very long flashlight.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	as she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the 
	entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled 
	against the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into 
	the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam 
	on the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor 
	outside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters, 
	goes to the windows, plays the beam on them.  Everything's 
	all right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second 
	bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	climbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first 
	door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light 
	on the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor, 
	goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to 
	the windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back 
	toward the door when she stops.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	looking.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR
</b>
	a pile of chipped and broken plaster.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	turning the flashlight up toward the ceiling.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE CEILING
</b>
	A huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	turning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face, 
	and suddenly, her eyes open wide.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - AN OWL
</b>
	sitting in the darkness, staring at her.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	reacting.

<b>	QUICK MED. SHOT - THE OWL
</b>
	wings spread in the beam of light.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	backing to the door. The owl hits her, sends her staggering 
	back, causing the door to slam shut. She looks up at the

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CEILING
</b>
	a swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward 
	her.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	in the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds 
	attack her.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	in the room, as the owl hits her full in the face.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	swinging the flashlight as the birds attack her.

<b>				MITCH (O.S.)
</b>		Melanie!

<b>	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS
</b>
	grotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is 
	a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering 
	wings.

<b>				MITCH (O.S.)
</b>		Melanie, open the door!

	He hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie 
	struggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed 
	by the birds.

	She falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the 
	spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering 
	of wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault 
	on the door by Mitch outside.

<b>				LYDIA (O.S.)
</b>			(screaming)
		Mitch, get her out of there!

<b>	MED. SHOT - THE ROOM
</b>
	Melanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in 
	view. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see 
	on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside.

<b>				MITCH (O.S.)
</b>		Melanie!

	The door begins to open.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room.  He 
	begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for 
	Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins 
	dragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been 
	shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding.  
	We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch 
	pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut 
	behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at 
	the few birds that have escaped into the corridor.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Mother, get a rope!

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Oh, my God, look at her!

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(shouting)
		Get a rope!

	She rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds.  
	There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He 
	will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his 
	hand, knocking the club from it.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	as the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his 
	hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob.  
	Another bird flutters into the corridor.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his 
	hands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and 
	is immediately attacked by the other bird.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(yelling)
		Mother! Hurry!

<b>	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
</b>
	as she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a 
	heavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily 
	to the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and 
	compassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the 
	doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to 
	the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to 
	Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia 
	following. As they go downstairs:

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Cathy! Get a blanket and some 
		bandages!

<b>				CATHY
</b>			(at the foot of the 
			stars, on the verge 
			of tears)
		Is she all right?

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	cradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		I'm... I'm....

<b>	FULL SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	as he carries her into the living room, but her down on the 
	couch.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Just lie there and keep still.

	Cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket.  
	By the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over 
	Melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands 
	are trembling, and he drops it.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Let me do that, Mitch.

	She picks up the bandage.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I can handle it.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		I know you can.
			(her eyes meet his)
		But I'd like to.

	He nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(weakly)
		Please don't mess me up with bandages, 
		Mrs. Brenner.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Shhhh. Shhhh.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Please.

	But she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the 
	cuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(as she works)
		I'm not very good at this, Mitch.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		You're doing fine.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(Apologizing)
		I mean. I want to...

	Pause.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Listen!

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
	raising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to 
	hear.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		They're gone. God have mercy, they're 
		gone.

<b>	FULL SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the 
	table and chair. He opens the door a crack.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE YARD
</b>
	through the crack. Daylight is almost here. There are no 
	birds visible.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE DOOR
</b>
	from outside as Mitch opens it wider. The door is scarred 
	and splintered. As he opens the door, one or two dead birds 
	spill into the room. He steps out into the yard. Lydia is 
	directly behind him.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE
</b>
	a shambles, all the windows broken.

<b>	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>		They're gone. The same pattern.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		But they'll be back.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		We won't be here.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Where can we go, Mitch? There's no 
		place to go.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I want to try for San Francisco.  
		There are buildings there. Steel and 
		concrete!

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(shaking her head)
		We'd never make it. They're probably 
		all over the road.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		We have to try it.
			(a long silence)
		We can't stay here.
			(silence)
		Melanie needs help.
			(silence)
		Mother, the house won't take another 
		attack.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		If...
			(pause)
		If... when we get to San Francisco...
			(pause)
		If they're already there?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		They won't be.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		If they are?

<b>				MITCH
</b>		We'll worry about that when we get 
		there.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		I'm frightened, terribly frightened.  
		I... I don't know what's out there, 
		Mitch.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		What do we have to know, Mother?  
		We're all together, we all love each 
		other, we all need each other. What 
		else is there? Mother, I want us to 
		stay alive!

<b>				LYDIA
</b>			(nodding; then after 
			a pause)
		I started to say... inside...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		You don't have to.

	He holds out his hand to her.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		I think we'd better get started.

<b>							  DISSOLVE
</b>
<b>	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD
</b>
	It is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before 
	dawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following 
	until the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is 
	deafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's 
	convertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house 
	together and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the 
	back seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background 
	is the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia 
	comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking 
	down at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the 
	house.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
</b>
	She is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just 
	outside the doorway. She looks at Mitch.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	looking back at her.

<b>	FULL SHOT - CATHY, MITCH, AND LYDIA
</b>
	Across the expanse of the desolated yard.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		May I take them, Mitch?

	He does not answer. She continues looking at him.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		They haven't harmed anyone.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Take them.

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(with a slow nod)
		We'll put them in the trunk, Cathy.

	He takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car.  
	The CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front 
	seat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops, 
	and looks toward the trees.

<b>	MED. SHOT - THE TREES
</b>
	covered with waiting birds.

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	getting into car.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Be careful with that door.

	Cathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch 
	does the same with his door.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>			(weakly)
		Mitch, if they hear the car 
		starting... if they see movement...

<b>				MITCH
</b>		We'll take it slow until we get to 
		the main road.

		Are you ready?

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HAND
</b>
	turning the key. The motor springs to life.

<b>	FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR
</b>
	anticipation on all the faces.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		All right.
			(he takes a deep breath)
		Here we go.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CAR
</b>
	from the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is 
	still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it 
	passes the gate and starts down the road.

<b>	MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
</b>
	as they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small 
	fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact.  
	The car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the 
	road.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW
</b>
	She gasps quickly.

<b>	MED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE
</b>
	standing, waiting silently.

	as the tension begins to starts.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Shhh.  Shhhh.

<b>	MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
</b>
	as they approach the derelict barge. It is covered with 
	waiting seagulls.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	seeing them. Her lip begins to tremble.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	turning toward the side of the road ahead.

<b>	FULL SHOT - AN OVERTURNED SCHOOL BUS - MITCH'S P.O.V.
</b>
	covered with waiting birds.

<b>				CATHY
</b>			(whispering)
		Mitch, let's turn back.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		Shhh. Shhhhh.

<b>	MED. SHOT - A ROADSIDE HOUSE
</b>
	as the car passes. A barricade has been set up on the front 
	porch, and a man is leaning over it, dead, a shotgun in his 
	hands. The porch is covered with waiting birds. At the boarded 
	window, we see a woman and child peering from a gap.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
</b>
	reacting.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V.
</b>
	as it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding 
	road to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still-
	standing wires, watching, waiting.

	FULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as 
	the car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of 
	birds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every 
	pole, on every fence.

<b>				LYDIA
</b>		Mitch!

<b>	MED. SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	as he stops the car and looks ahead.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CAR
</b>
	in the middle of the road, stopped. Ahead are the birds.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	frightened, try not to reveal her fear.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Can we turn back?

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
<b>				MITCH
</b>		I... I don't think so. If we get 
		through town, I think we'll be all 
		right.

<b>	FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR
</b>
	There is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest 
	reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing, 
	who makes the decision.

<b>				MELANIE
</b>		Then go ahead, Mitch.

<b>	FULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR
</b>
	as it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow 
	rate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds.

	closing her eyes.

<b>	FULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE
</b>
	through the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with 
	birds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all 
	over the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the 
	open door and across the road, dead people are lying in the 
	gutter. But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken 
	windows.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - EXTERIOR

	as Mitch rams the accelerator to the floor and it zooms ahead 
	in a burst of speed.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THOUSANDS OF BIRDS

	taking wing.

	through the windshield, as a flock of birds take wing 
	immediately ahead.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDSHIELD

	from the inside, as birds flutter against it.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF OF THE CAR

	wrenching at the wheel again, another bend.

<b>	HELICOPTER SHOT - THE CAR

	navigating the sharp bends in the road as birds streak at it

<b>	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE
</b>
	in the back seat as several slashes appear in the roof over 
	their heads, letting in more light.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF
</b>
	More slashes, more light in scattered beams.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	her fear growing as the scattered light beams bring back the 
	memory of the attic room and her flashlight battle with the 
	owl.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF
</b>
	more slashes, building, the beak thrusts combining with the 
	incoming beams of light in a weirdly horrifying way.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

		Dear God... dear God... please,

		Can't they leave us alone?
			(shrieking it)
<b>		LEAVE US ALONE!
</b>
	MED. SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR all the passengers, as the roof 
	suddenly rips back.

<b>	FULL SHOT - BIRDS
</b>
	from inside the car, hovering over it the moment the roof 
	tears back.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</b>
	This is too much for her. She screams at sight of the birds, 
	and then turns her face into Lydia's shoulder.

<b>	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE
</b>
	as Lydia recognizes Melanie's need. She puts her arm around 
	Melanie's shoulder and gently, soothingly, holds her close.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CAR
</b>
	racing along as the birds hover over it.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	his face screwed in anguish, tears rolling down his cheeks 
	as he grips the wheel and hits the gas pedal.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE OPEN CAR
</b>
	streaming canvas ribbons behind it. It turns another bend in 
	the road.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - (THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD)
</b>
	It is arrow-straight, no curves.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CAR
</b>
	in a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway. It begins 
	to outdistance the birds. The gap widens. A flock of birds 
	attacks it from the side of the road, but it speeds into 
	them and through them. The gap grows wider and wider. They 
	are well ahead of the birds now.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA
</b>
<b>				LYDIA
</b>		We're losing them.

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</b>
	only a nod, his face streaming tears.

<b>	LONG SHOT - THE CAR (BIRDS' P.O.V.)
</b>
	as they fall way behind now, the car moving swiftly into the 
	distance.

<b>	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE
</b>
	on the back seat. Melanie begins sobbing in a sudden release 
	of tension. Lydia, in compassion, and tenderly, cradles 
	Melanie's head on her shoulder. Melanie, her eyes glistening, 
	looks ahead through the windshield.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR
</b>
	all their faces visible.

<b>				CATHY
</b>		Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll 
		be all right? In the trunk? Can they 
		breath?

<b>				MITCH
</b>			(with the faintest 
			smile)
		I think they'll be all right, honey.

	There is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the 
	wind. Not a wild exuberance, but a relaxation of tension.  
	They stare ahead through the windshield, and then they squint 
	their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead, and Mitch reaches 
	up to turn down the sun visor.

<b>				MITCH
</b>		It looks... it looks clear up ahead.

<b>	FULL SHOT - THE CAR
</b>
	moving AWAY FROM THE CAMERA FAST into magnificent sunrise 
	over the crest of the hills. Further and further into the 
	distance it goes.

</b>
<b>					 THE END
