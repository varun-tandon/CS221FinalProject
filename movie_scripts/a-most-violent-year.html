<b>          JANUARY 31, 1981
</b>          Over black we hear the opening of a garage door. The light
          spills in and we see.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. UPPER MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, QUEENS NYC -

          Open on ABEL MORALES. It is early morning and still almost
          dark out. He has a rugged yet prosperously-handsome face and
          is in his mid-thirties. He is struggling to get started with
          his morning jog.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. SHIP GRAVEYARD, STATEN ISLAND NYC - DAY
</b>                         
          It is early morning. A large bulk fuel oil transport truck
          sits idling next to a decrepit old dock. The dock sticks into
          a backwater section of New York harbor that is filled with
          the decaying remains of half-sunken abandoned barges and tug
          boats.
                         
          JULIAN, the young driver of the truck sits and nervously
          scans the horizon. Eventually a large fuel barge appears in
          the distance being pushed by a tug boat. The barge is steered
          past the skeletons of the other sunken ships and makes its
          way to the dock in front of the tanker truck.
                         
          JULIAN gets out of his truck and readies a large connecting
          hose. He looks around nervously. JULIAN steps across the
          broken boards of the dock and struggles to get the hose to
          the barge. He hands it to the BARGE OPERATOR with a nod of
          the head and no words.
                         
          They connect the hose and start a large generator as it
          begins to pump fuel into the truck. They both scan the
          horizon again as the sun begins to come up.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. MORE INDUSTRIAL QUEENS NEIGHBORHOOD- SAME TIME
</b>                         
          ABEL is still jogging as the light begins to increase. It is
          freezing out. He is a very serious guy. He is not happy that
          he is out of shape. Finally he stops and bends over to catch
          his breath. We have run with him from the nicer part of the
          neighborhood to a rougher section. As he catches his breath
          he stands up and looks around. He is unsure of his feelings.

<b>          INT. ANNA'S DRESSING AREA
</b>          The camera slowly moves in as ANNA sits in a slip at her make
          up table putting on her face for the day ahead. She looks
          into the mirror as if she is putting on a coat of armor.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. DRIVER'S CAB OF A BULK OIL TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY
</b>                         
          STANDARD HEATING OIL, "We set the Standard" is written in
          logo form on the side of the tank.
                         
          The truck idles in traffic waiting to pay the toll to cross
          the Verrazano bridge that spans the mouth of New York harbor.
                         
          JULIAN, the young driver from the dock, cautiously looks
          around as the traffic inches along. He finally approaches the
          toll booth and pays.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Good morning.
                         
          JULIAN speaks English with a well-sanded accent. Is it
          Central American or Mexican? The female collector gives him a
          smile.
          He heads through the booth, but there is still traffic on the
          other side as the lanes merge together. Just as the traffic
          is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we
          see TWO GUYS come walking through the traffic and towards the
          cab. Before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps.
                         
          The GUY on the driver's side, LOUIS SERVIDIO, is small and
          very slight but he moves with great speed and strength. He
          shatters the glass side window with his elbow. Unlocks the
          door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the
          passenger side, but he is holding a gun. They are not wearing
          masks. It's very brazen.
                         
          Before THUG #2 even asks JULIAN to get out of the cab LOUIS
          SERVIDIO crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then
          pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway.
                         
          LOUIS SERVIDIO pulls the door shut and they drive away with
          the truck leaving JULIAN sitting in the middle of the road
          staring, as blood starts to flow from his jaw.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. PARKING YARD OF STANDARD HEATING OIL- SAME TIME
</b>                         
          Two almost-matching late model Mercedes pull up to a chain-
          link gate with a small sign that says "STANDARD HEATING OIL:
          WE SET THE STANDARD". The DISPATCHER opens the gate.
<b>                          4
</b>                         
                         
          They both pull into reserved parking spaces next to each
          other. ABEL is dressed in a very tasteful custom made suit.
          ABEL's wife ANNA was driving the car behind him. She is a
          beautiful, tall, blonde woman dressed to the nines but with a
          streak in her eye that this is all business. You would not
          want to cross this woman.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Ready?
<b>                          ANNA
</b>           Yes.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           You look very nice.
                         
<b>                          ANNA
</b>           Thank you.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           You sure?
                         
<b>                          ANNA
</b>           Yes.
                         
          ABEL walks around and opens his trunk. He takes out two large
          empty briefcases.
                         
          He carries the briefcases as they both walk over to a large,
          unmarked, armored van that is idling in the middle of the
          parking lot. Two ARMED GUARDS get out of the van. One is
          holding a clipboard. He walks up to ANNA and ABEL. He hands
          them the clipboard. They look at each other one last time and
          then both sign the document.
                         
          The other GUARD opens up the back of the truck. ABEL hands
          him the briefcases and the guard begins to fill them with
          cash. Lots of cash. ABEL and ANNA stand at the open back of
          the van and just watch. Finally he finishes and hands the now-
          heavy cases to ABEL.
                         
          ABEL picks up the two cases and walks a bit away from the
          truck. He turns to ANNA.
                         
<b>                          ANNA (CONT'D)
</b>           Don't do anything stupid.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           We don't have any more money so
           what else could I do.
                         
          She gives a small smile. He looks at his watch. They kiss.
<b>                          5
</b>                         
                         
          ABEL turns and begins walking with the cases. He gives a nod
          to the DISPATCHER, who we now see, is in a small gatehouse,
          and he begins to open the front gate.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE FRONT GATE- SAME TIME
</b>                         
          ABEL walks out through the gate and down the abandoned
          industrial street about 25 yards, then looks to his right. He
          looks down at the cases in his hands, turns, and stands
          looking into the neighboring site.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM: BROOKLYN NY WATERFRONT - DAY
</b>                         
          ABEL comes walking across the parking lot and sees ANDREW
          WALSH standing in the middle of the dusty parking lot. ANDREW
          is their longtime LAWYER/RIGHT-HAND MAN and is in his mid
          fifties. He is smart but tired. The oversized briefcase in
          his left hand seems to have permanently tilted his posture
          that direction. The large oil-holding tanks loom above them.
          The place is rusting and could use some work.
                         
          As they wait, the setting has the look and choreography of an
          illegal transaction about to go down.
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           So how are we this morning?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           (gives a smile and nod)
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           Well I woke up feeling very good
           about this.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Really?
                         
          They both take a look at their watches.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           You've been telling me not to do
           this for a year.
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH
</b>           Well we are going all in... so now
           I love it.
                         
          Gives him another slight smile. They stand around in awkward
          silence. Finally a late-model Ford Ltd. station wagon pulls
          into the lot.

<b>           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
</b>           Here we go.
          And a group of FIVE HASIDIC JEWS gets out. There are two guys
          in their twenties, two in their fifties, and one in his mid-
          to-late seventies. They all shake each other's hands then
          stand around for a beat.
                         
<b>           ANDREW WALSH (CONT'D)
</b>           Should we head inside?
                         
<b>          INT. SMALL TEMPORARY OFFICE TRAILER - DAY
</b>                         
          The group is now jammed around a folding table inside the
          trailer. ABEL and his lawyer sit at one end facing the rest
          of them. Finally, the senior member of the group, JOSEPH
          MENDELSOHN, eyes up ABEL and leans forward. His accent is
          strong yet you can understand every word.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Almost two.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           There are many like it around? And
           thanks to all these tests you paid
           for, we now know it is as much of a
           mess below the ground as it is
           above. My people have looked at
           your books, I know this is a lot of
           money for you, so why have you kept
           on us so... just for this ugly and
           polluted little piece of the earth.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I have been looking over my fence

           time.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH

</b>           No... I imagine I want it for the
           same reason you did.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH

</b>           To grow.
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           Well, I am in the garment business
           so I appreciate that sentiment. But
           I inherited this land from my
           uncle. Sadly he had no children of
           his own. He was the one that let
           them build these tanks here. So
           this place can do little for me...
           in fact thanks to all those tests
           you've done it may be a liability.
           As you know I offered to lease the
           site to you at a fair price, but
           you were not interested?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           No.
<b>                          JOSEPH
</b>           Why not?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I like to own the things I use.
                         
<b>                          JOSEPH

           you is because of the favorable
           terms of this contract. So this is
           business... and when you sign
           this....

          ABEL turns to ANDREW and gives a slight nod. ANDREW pulls the
          black briefcase onto the table and opens it. It has seven
          hundred thousand dollars in cash in it. He slides it over to
          their side. The old man signs the contract and they shake
          hands.

          He heads out towards the tanks and walks among them. They
          tower seven stories above him. As he walks, he is cut off
          like a maze from any other visual input. (Similar to being
          inside a Richard Serra sculpture) Finally he emerges into
          some light and as ABEL looks up the camera reveals his view.
          It's midtown Manhattan in all its glory, just across the East
          River from the site. He stares at the city and we see the
          true depths of his ambition lock on his face. He looks to his
          watch.

          Then an architect-designed, 80's modern house, still under
          construction, appears. He pulls up in front.
                         
          He gets out of the car and stands there looking at the large
          house. He walks into the house and we see more clearly that
          it is nearing completion. It is empty.

          ABEL reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out a thick

          looking across the ridge back at his house. He is a little
          out of breath after climbing the hill but he looks strangely
          comfortable even though he is standing in the woods in a
          suit, tie, and dress shoes. He takes a nice cigar out of his
          pocket, lights it and has a real moment of joy. He looks up
          to the tops of the trees, then back at the new house. He
          exhales a long deep breath. Then we hear a large truck come
          rumbling in the driveway. He hears it. His face shows that he
          knows the sound immediately.

          places him back down on the table.

          They look each other over. She then finally leans in and
          gives him a caring kiss, she walks off.

          He watches her walk away then looks back into the hospital

          They stare at each other, then the truck. ABEL then climbs up

          The cop leaves. ABEL is left standing on top of the truck in
          the parking lot alone with his battered truck. He looks down
          at the open loading valve and begins to come up with an idea.

           around in this city, just trying to
           do their jobs. And I... I have done
           everything you have asked of me.
           It's been two years since you first
           started investigating my company
           and I have spent thousands of
           dollars hiring lawyers for this and
           that to provide you with every
           piece of information your office
           has requested. And I expect that
           you have been asking the same from
           my competitors. So with all this
           information that you have gained...
           We are just asking if you have any
           idea who has been doing this to us?

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
</b>           I understand your frustration. And
           although everyone else seems to
           have given up and left this city
           for dead, I haven't. And as you
           know we have been investigating
           industry-wide corruption in your
           business that seems to have been
           going on for years. And the simple
           fact is that the only person who
           could do anything with 8000 gallons
           of heating oil in a matter of
           minutes after stealing a truck is
           someone from within that industry.
           And almost certainly someone with
           local storage capacity. So you're
           right. That means you all are
           stealing from each other. Which is,
           as far as I can tell, just a
           refreshing new take on what you've
           been doing to your customers and
           fellow taxpayers for the last
           fifteen years.
                         
          This sits in the room for a long beat.
<b>                          ABEL

           the work you are doing to try to

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           Well yes and no. See, all that I

           away in the simplest and most
           economical way possible with the
           limited resources at my disposal.
           It doesn't really matter to us who
           it is or how we do it as long as
           it's progress.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Well, it makes a difference to me.

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I know it does. This city is a very
           difficult place to do business
           right now.

          next reply for a long beat.
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           You know... Mr. Morales you seem
           like a decent man, and because of
           that I'm really not comfortable
           just sitting here with you
           pretending that the elephant
           perched on the corner of my desk
           isn't there.
                         
          LAWRENCE looks over at DEPUTY LANGE whose body language says
          `don't go down this road'. But he does.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
</b>           I can't go into specifics at this
           moment but we believe that you and
           your company have broken the law
           and that we have enough evidence to
           prove that. So next week, Monday
           actually, we will be bringing a
           case against you.
                         
          This drops like a bomb. ABEL and LAWRENCE stare at each
          other. Then ABEL glances to the corner of the desk. We see
          that a large draft copy of the case is actually sitting
          there. ABEL looks back up.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm sorry to do this in person.
           It's awkward, obviously, but I
           didn't want to have this happen on
           Monday not having said something
           here in person today, out of
           respect.

          ABEL stands up to leave and ANDREW is still a little stunned
          but stands.

          ABEL walks out of the shop and looks around. It is now dark
          outside.

          ABEL is jogging again but this time he is deep in the woods.
          He runs along the road. We then hear a car coming from behind
          him. The car noise then turns into more of a truck noise. He
          stops and turns around as we see a large truck coming towards
          him.
                         
          He gets himself over to the side of the road. We have a
          slight fear it might hit him. But as it passes we see it's a
          large moving truck. There's a second one following right
          behind it.

          As the trucks pass it registers on ABEL's face. He cuts into
          a path in the woods.

          ABEL walks up to his house, and we see the moving trucks
          preparing to unload. ANNA gets out of her car with the kids,
          and they run around and check out the house as ANNA directs
          the movers.
          ABEL comes up and stands next to her. They smile a protected
          smile at their new home. ABEL gives her a kiss.

          The whole family sits around the table in candlelight. They
          are eating takeout, but with a mismatch of formal and
          everyday tableware that has been unpacked. There are boxes
          all around them.

          ABEL is standing watching the game as he waits for his coffee

          ABEL picks up his coffee, and they both walk back over to the
          sideline together. Although they are standing a bit off to
          the side from everyone else.

           we've been taking. We haven't had
           an incident since November. It
           doesn't do any of us any good to
           have this kind of attention brought
           to us.

<b>          INT. GARAGE OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY
</b>                         
          The garage is filled with boxes. ABEL stands in the middle of
          a few that are partially unpacked. He has set up an old radio
          in the corner of the garage, and it is playing a New York
          Giants football game. ABEL takes an object out of one of the
          boxes and looks at it with significance.
                         
          Coming from the main house we hear the doorbell ring. ABEL'S
          oldest daughter, ANNIE, comes to the door of the garage.
                         
<b>                          ANNIE

          ABEL looks around behind ANNIE to see ANDREW standing there.
          He waves him into the garage. The boxes are stacked almost
          to the ceiling around them.

          This hits ABEL. He thinks for a beat than goes over to the
          door to the house and calls for his wife.

          ABEL reaches into his pocket and takes out a remote for the

          pride in his face as this remote is a fairly high-tech new
          item. They all sit and watch as it opens the whole way then
          stops in silence.

          ABEL is lying in bed, awake. ANNA is as well. He is staring
          at the ceiling. Their dog is lying at the foot of the bed
          asleep as well. Eventually the dog wakes up and looks out
          towards the doorway. He growls ever so lightly. Then he
          stops, listens, and starts growling a little more.
                         
          ANNA looks up ever so slightly.

<b>          INT. HALLWAYS/KID'S ROOMS - NIGHT
</b>          ABEL walks out of the bedroom and slowly heads down the hall
          to his kids' rooms. He looks in each room and the CHILD is
          sleeping soundly with nothing out of place.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. KIDS' ROOMS/HALLWAY- SAME TIME

          As he comes out of the last bedroom back into the hallway he
          sees his dog standing at the top of the stairs looking down
          over the balcony into the living room. The dog is starting to
          quietly growl once again.
                         
          ABEL'S face goes from total comfort that his kids are safe to
          total paranoia. He slowly walks down the hall. He stops off
          in his bedroom closet and grabs a mid-size baseball bat/billy
          club. Now he is heading down the stairs with the club trying
          not to freak himself out.

</b>                         
          ABEL walks down the stairs and the dog just stands at the
          top, still growling every now and then. ABEL comes into the
          living room and everything seems perfectly normal. He then
          relaxes and turns towards the dog.
                         
<b>                          ABEL

           here.
                         
          He snaps his fingers and calls the dog. The dog finally comes
          down the stairs.
                         
          ABEL now heads towards the kitchen in a relaxed state, but
          then the dog starts growling again and looking out the
          windows next to the front door. ABEL comes over, he opens the
          front door but the dog refuses to go out.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           Go. Oh come on. Go.
                         
          ABEL thinks he hears something. He clicks on the lights and
          pulls his bat back up into position. He heads outside.

<b>          EXT. FRONT DOOR TO ABEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>          ABEL comes to the end of the front walk and there is nothing.
          The dog has now followed him outside and is slowly heading
          over to a area where a small exterior hallway leads to a side
          entrance. It is dark. The dog starts barking and going crazy.
          ABEL slowly heads over to the covered passageway.
                         
          All hell now breaks lose. A BURGLAR, in all black, comes
          blasting out of the shadows. The dog tries to bite him as he
          goes by. ABEL swings his club and hits BURGLAR square on the
          shoulder but he keeps coming. He knocks ABEL over and runs
          towards the driveway. ABEL is up and chasing after him faster
          than we expect.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. BASE OF THE RAVINE DEEP IN WOODS- CONTINUOUS
</b>                         
          There is a pretty good moon out so we can see them running
          full throttle through the very thick woods. ABEL is keeping
          up with him and in fact may be gaining on him.
                         
          ABEL is still in his pajamas. He has a rage that has been
          building up inside him for a good two weeks that is now
          pouring out of him in the energy to chase this guy down.
          They come to the top of a small ravine which ABEL seems to
          know from his runs through the woods and ABEL takes a bit of
          an easier/quicker path down.

</b>                         
          ABEL now cuts him off at an angle and swings the bat at his
          legs. BURGLAR trips and goes flying. ABEL falls as he swings
          at him. They both sit on the ground for a beat. ABEL is
          exhausted. They stare at each other.
                         
          A brief look of panic comes across BURGLAR's face. Then he is
          up again and running off into the woods.
                         
          ABEL gets himself up and chases after him.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. ROAD NEXT TO THE WOODS - NIGHT
</b>                         
          ABEL comes out of the woods into the middle of the road, and
          in the distance we see BURGLAR run up to a waiting van with
          its lights and engine on. The guy gets into the passenger
          side of the van, and it peels out.
                         
          ABEL is left standing in the middle of the road, barely able
          to breathe and holding the bat.

          standing with all the lights on and with the dog sitting next
          to her. She looks at him in shock.

          They both look down at his bare feet. He has been in some
          kind of shock and hasn't even noticed that his bare feet are
          cut up to pieces from running in the woods through the ice.
          His feet are bleeding all over the walkway.

          ANNA is in warrior mode. Any panic in her voice has
          disappeared, and she is speaking with a calm yet deadly
          seriousness. She is cleaning the cuts on his feet and putting
          bandages on them as they talk.

          She looks at him with considerable concern.
                         
          He leans in and starts kissing her. She holds still at first
          then gives in.

          ABEL is in a suit but is kneeling and almost lying on his
          back showing three SALES RECRUITS what they should be looking
          for. Another INSTRUCTOR looks on. We see ABEL in his element.
          He is a salesman.
                         
<b>                          ABEL

           the opening to the burn chamber.
           Now at this point you have not
           tipped your hat in anyway. From the
           minute you walked in the house you
           should have been working to create
           an impression of total
           impartiality. But now...
                         
          He reaches over and opens the small door. A fire is burning
          inside. On cue the instructor hands ABEL a crisp clean white
          handkerchief.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           When this door opens you begin to
           close. It must always be spotless.
           If they see you have ever done this
           before it is over.
                         
          He takes it and reaches up into a small exhaust chimney.

           slowly just start shaking your

</b>           It means you are close... Then
           after sitting in silence way longer
           than is comfortable, you turn. And
           say "I'd love to run a few numbers
           for you. Is there somewhere more
           comfortable we could sit." They
           will almost always take you to the
           dining room table and will offer
           you something. And whatever it is
           you always take the fancy option.

           them what we can save them over the
           long haul through proper
           maintenance, you need them to sign.
           And the problem is by hiring you
           that means they are firing someone
           else. And that's never easy. So to
           get them over the line you need to
           close them. So when you show them
           the number look up at them both...
           and just stare at them...
                         
          ABEL begins staring at the recruits. He continues to stare.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           You stare longer than you should.
           Because this is not a joke. You
           will only keep this job if you
           close. And that's not funny to you.
           And I am only interested in this
           company growing, and when it isn't
           I don't think it's funny at all.
           These people work very hard for
           their money and these other guys
           are ripping them off, treating them
           poorly, because they don't know...
           so when you look them in the eye
           you have to believe that we are
           better, and we are, but you will
           never do anything as hard as
           staring a person straight in the
           eye and telling the truth.
                         
          ABEL then does exactly that to them. And he holds it for a
          long beat.

          There is a great high/low nature to the way ABEL runs the
          company. While he wears great suits and his trucks are
          impeccable, he does not waste money. So this room where the
          drivers have company meetings is very basic.

          The room is filled with all of the drivers. There is a bit
          of a nervous energy in the room. It quiets as ABEL comes in.

          stops. ABEL walks forward a few steps.

          ANNA is walking back from the mailbox looking through the
          day's mail. As she approaches the house she looks up and sees
          the two younger daughters, ELIZABETH (6 years old) and
          CATHERINE (4 years old), playing in front of the house.
          CATHERINE comes out from under a bush near the side door with
          something in her hand.
                         
          ANNA looks back down at the mail. As she gets closer to the
          house we see a look of concern come across her face. The look
          then turns to one of complete horror but as she gets closer
          to CATHERINE she tries to control her emotions.

          As ANNA comes up to CATHERINE we now see that the little girl
          is holding a large very real looking handgun in her little
          hands. ANNA is besides herself.

</b>           We need to sit down with them
           immediately. I set a dinner. We
           need you both there to lay
           everything out and be totally up-
           front. This shouldn't be a problem.
           Lord knows they've given money to
           bigger crooks than us. But I don't
           want us hiding anything from them.

           So let me think this through. But
           whatever decision I make on this,

           it always does. And if you want

           stay in business long enough it's
           bound to happen eventually.

</b>           Well that's exactly right. And we
           wanted to sit down with you tonight
           to make sure we were being totally
           up-front with everything that is
           going on and make sure that you
           understand the nature of the
           complaints and are comfortable that
           it is not going to affect our
           business in an adverse way.

           pay off any and all fines and be
           able to move forward with very
           comfortable capital on hand.
                         
          ABEL jumps in taking some offense.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           But you should know Arthur that
           this man has been digging through
           our industry for over two years
           looking for anything he can find.
           And as you know probably better
           than anyone, having worked with
           some of our competitors the thought
           that he would have singled us out
           is ridiculous. It reeks of
           everything that is wrong with this
           city right now. We run a fair and
           clean business and follow every
           standard industry practice and I
           will fight `til my last day to
           prove that...
          This silences the table for a long beat.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)

          ABEL holds up his finger and points at ARTHUR across the
          table to make his point.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           ...Don't think for a moment that I
           am going to allow this mess to
           interfere with our plan to grow. We
           need to know you are standing by
           us.
                         
<b>           BANK VP IAN THOMPSON
</b>           Yes, what is it with this piece of
           property that you find so integral
           or that can't be put off `til after
           this legal matter is dealt with?
                         
          ABEL is a little taken aback by this comment. It goes against
          everything that comes naturally to him as a person. ANNA and
          ANDREW know this and are concerned he might go off.
                         
          ABEL thinks it through.

</b>           That's a very good question. This
           property gives us many things...
           firstly direct access to the river.
           So I can bring in fuel directly
           from any provider in the world
           straight to my tanks, then it has
           over 10 million gallons of storage
           capacity, so I can buy in the
           summers when my price is low and
           sell to my customers and most
           importantly some of my competitors
           when the price is high. I won't
           just drive trucks anymore... I will
           control my fate... but the real
           answer to your question...
                         
          Now ABEL stares right at IAN THOMPSON.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           ... is that when it feels scary to
           jump Ian... that is exactly when
           you must jump... or you risk ending
           up staying in the same place your
           whole life... and that I can't do.
          IAN THOMPSON awkwardly laughs a bit as ABEL just stays deadly
          serious staring right at him. Finally.

          ABEL is driving, and ANNA sits in silence looking out the
          passenger window. They are heading along the main backwoods
          road to their house.
                         
<b>                          ANNA

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes. Arthur is a good man.
                         
<b>                          ANNA

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Of course.

          Just as he says this a deer comes running out in front of
          them. ABEL tries to slam on the brakes but isn't able to stop
          in time. The car hits the deer and it careens over the
          windshield and on to the road behind the car.
                         
          He continues to slam on the brakes and comes to a complete
          stop.
                         
          They both catch their breath and look around to make sure
          they are both okay. Then they look back at the deer. It is
          laying on the road but is still breathing.
                         
<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)

          ABEL gets out of the car and looks at his smashed hood. He
          then walks back and approaches the animal. It is laying on
          the side of the road.
                         
          He comes right up to it and stares into its eyes. It stares
          back at him. ABEL walks back to the car.

          He reaches down to open the trunk.

          This whole situation has stressed them out and they are on
          edge.
                         
          ABEL goes to the trunk and gets out the large wrench. He
          walks back over to the deer. He bends down next to it and
          stares into its eye again. ABEL is thinking back on
          something, or many things.
          He makes a small starting movement like he is going to hit it
          over the head but he stops himself. He can't quite do it.
          Then he sits with the animal a beat longer.
                         
          We come in very close to ABEL and see his hand is struggling
          to deliver the blow. Just as he grips the tire iron
          waiting... BANG! BANG!
                         
          Two very loud GUNSHOTS go off from right over his shoulder.
          He ducks for cover then slowly turns behind him. ANNA stands
          there holding a small-yet-powerful Saturday Night Special-
          style handgun. Smoke is still rising from the end of the
          pistol. The deer is dead.
                         
          He looks at her dumbfounded... where did she get this gun?
          She gives him a look. Then turns and walks back to the car.
          He stays and struggles to get the deer out of the road.

          ANNA is sitting in the car waiting. We hear ABEL'S footsteps
          as he approaches the open driver's side door. He gets in
          without saying a word. We stay with them as they drive on in
          silence.

          The door opens and ABEL walks in. ANNA is already in the
          house talking with NANNY MARIA who's been baby-sitting.

          NANNY MARIA comes around the corner and passes ABEL who is
          just standing in the living room. He only gives her a nod.
          ANNA is standing on the other side of the room just waiting
          in silence as well. NANNY MARIA goes over to the closet and
          gets her coat out and puts it on. The tension is building
          like a kettle. Finally NANNY MARIA gets herself together and
          walks out and as the door shuts they come immediately at each
          other.

          ABEL is slightly stammering at this point, not quite sure
          what to do. They are still standing on opposite sides of the
          room from each other. He just waits... finally.

          This sets him off. He comes walking across the room at her as
          if he might hit her. He gets closer and closer.

          JULIAN is close to getting off the bridge and is starting to
          feel better. Just as the traffic in front of him starts to
          clear up, out of the corner of his eye he sees something.
          In his side-view mirror he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO getting out of
          a random car behind him. His heart starts racing. He looks
          over in the other mirror and there is THUG #2 walking up.
          Again.
                         
          JULIAN thinks for a second then reaches for the CB RADIO.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN

          He then fumbles the CB and it drops to the floor of the cab.
          He looks up into the mirrors again and sees that they are
          still coming for him.
                         
          The camera now comes in tight on his face and he pauses for a
          long second, and he then makes his decision. He reaches under
          his seat and takes out a handgun. He doesn't really seem to
          know what he is doing with it.
                         
          But he opens the door of the truck and gets out. He aims the
          gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO walking towards him. LOUIS SERVIDIO
          sees him and is very surprised and stops.

          People in the cars behind the truck are starting to honk.
          Then LOUIS SERVIDIO gives a nod signal to THUG #2 who is on
          the other side of the truck, and JULIAN'S gun fires by
          mistake. It totally misses THUG #2. He jumps out of the way
          and is hiding behind the wheel.

           hurt someone.
                         
          JULIAN is now in a total state of panic. He is hiding back in
          front of the truck. The three men are basically doing a slow-
          motion, very stressful hide-and-seek around the truck. The
          two THUGS now have their guns out.
                         
          The honking has now reached a total insane level as traffic
          is backing up.
          Then THUG #2 makes one last play to take the truck. He tries
          to climb into the cab and JULIAN goes into a rage. He quickly
          fires three shots, missing THUG #2 with each one, but that
          forces LOUIS SERVIDIO to shoot two shots of his own at JULIAN
          to protect THUG #2. They miss as well, but one hits the main
          section of the tank and a small but steady stream of heating
          oil starts pouring out onto the roadway.
                         
          Just then we hear sirens starting to come closer in the

          all alone with the police coming. As JULIAN is hiding, trying
          to figure out what to do next, LOUIS SERVIDIO goes running by

           about four more flights. Don't go
           out there, that's the street. Go
           down about two more flights after
           that and you'll come out below the
           bridge. They won't be there.

</b>           You're welcome.
                         
          Then LOUIS SERVIDIO's head disappears and we can hear his
          feet flying down the steps again.
                         
          JULIAN thinks for a beat, then he starts off down the stairs
          again as well. The camera stays right where it was as JULIAN
          heads down out of sight. We just hear the sounds of his feet
          getting lower and lower.

          JULIAN comes to the first door and looks at it. We can hear
          sirens in the distance on the other side of the door. He
          keeps going.
                         
          Down two more flights, just as he said, there is another
          doorway. JULIAN walks up to that door very carefully. He
          listens on the other side but doesn't hear anything but his
          own breath.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. STAIR LANDING LOWEST LEVEL - DAY

          Then we hear the door back up top fly open. JULIAN then
          quietly opens the door in front of him and right in front of
          his face is a woman in full jogging clothes running by him.
          He looks around, and after a second to get himself
          orientated, we see he's on a riverfront esplanade where there
          are many people jogging and walking, enjoying the evening.

          JULIAN looks at his hand and realizes he is still holding the
          gun out in the open. He puts it away and then looks up at the
          bridge that is hovering above him.
                         
          He knows he left his life as he knew it up on that bridge.
                         
<b>           FADE TO BLACK.
</b>                         
          Over the black we begin to hear the rumble of a very large
          truck. It gets louder and louder.
                         
<b>          INT. OF A VERY LARGE EMPTY DUMPSTER - DAY
</b>                         
          We now see that SALES STUDENT ALEX is inside a massive, empty
          construction dumpster. And as he looks around, we realize it
          is on the back of a truck that is currently driving pretty
          fast. With each bump that the truck goes over the noise
          inside the dumpster is deafening. As the KID comes to his
          senses he tries to stand up. As he does, we see that the
          sides of the dumpster are at least eight feet tall and the
          interior is very slick without anything to grab or stand on.
          He is trapped.
                         
          Just then the truck goes over another huge bump and comes to
          a stop. It idles for a minute then begins backing up. It
          stops. A warning, beeping alarm is heard, and finally one end
          of the dumpster begins rising. As it gets higher and higher
          our KID tries to hold himself back, but he begins to slide
          towards the low end. As he does he sees that the end that he
          is heading towards is on a hinge and it is starting to swing
          open. Finally the thing is at such an angle that he can't
          hold on any longer and he slides towards the opening.
                         
          As he falls out he/we see that he's being dumped over the
          edge of a cliff of some sort. He falls probably 10-12 feet,
          into a pile of garbage. As he gathers himself and tries to
          stand, we see he is standing in a massive landfill. He looks
          around as the truck pulls away. He's left totally alone.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. TENNIS COURT OF SUBURBAN MANSION - DAY
</b>                         
          ABEL is led by a MAID into an indoor tennis court. The house
          is massive and designed like an English Country Estate.
                         
          As ABEL walks up we see PETER FORENTE on the court playing
          against an automatic tennis ball machine. He is in full
          tennis whites as he hammers the balls back at the machine.
                         
          ABEL approaches the court and watches for a beat.

</b>           Peter.
                         
          This causes PETER to look up and see the serious look on
          ABEL's face. He hits one last shot and walks a little closer
          to ABEL. The machine is still hitting balls behind PETER.
                         
<b>                          PETER FORENTE

</b>           I see that.
          PETER walks over to the machine and unplugs it. He points
          over towards the chairs courtside. He and ABEL sit down.

           house.
                         
          ABEL lets this sit for a minute, and he is intently reading
          PETER's face. He hopes not, but he is judging to see if PETER
          had anything to do with all these attacks. PETER just looks
          back at him with a very strong poker face.

          LAWRENCE looks around the room thinking while ABEL says
          nothing, just waiting.

</b>           You should. And when you do, bring
           him to us. A situation like this,
           happening in such a dangerous and
           public way, within an industry I'm
           charged with cleaning up. It's very
           bad for me... professionally
           speaking.

          SALES STUDENT ALEX is walking down the street looking
          terrible. His clothes are ruined by garbage, and he is
          scared. As he approaches his car his face drops.
                         
          The car has a two-by-four slammed through the shattered
          windshield.

          and scans the street looking for anything. It is eerily
          empty.

          does we see ARTHUR LEWIS standing waiting next to his car.
          ABEL pulls in next to him and gets out. There is an
          overriding, almost unsettling calm to this conversation.

          The banker gets into his car and backs out. The gate opens
          and he drives out. Just as it is about to close it starts
          opening again. SALES STUDENT ALEX drives in with his car
          trashed. He pulls up and gets out of the car looking at ABEL.
          He knows what has happened and is crushed. Neither of them
          say a word, finally ABEL gives the kid a cautious but
          meaningful hug around the shoulder and leads him inside.

</b>           No... I'm not... They're out.

          to his bedroom. When he's halfway up the stairs she stops
          him.

          ABEL is driving ANNA'S car towards the city. ANNA is in the
          passenger seat and the three DAUGHTERS are in the back. ANNA
          and ABEL do not look any better. In fact there is now a tinge
          of anger mixed into the sadness.
                         
          The DAUGHTERS are arguing about who's taking up too much room
          in the back seat.

          ANNA turns and snaps at them a bit.
<b>                          ANNA

          ELIZABETH (middle) nudges ANNIE (oldest) so she gives
          CATHERINE (youngest) a good hit. ANNA sees it and freaks.

          Before ANNA can get the full sentence out ABEL suddenly pulls
          the car off the side of the highway into the grass. Everyone
          in the car is taken aback. The road is a smaller scenic
          highway not some eight lane affair but this whole sequence
          still plays out with the menacing roar of the cars going by
          right next to them.

          ABEL gets out of the car and slams the door. He walks around
          the back of the car as the cars fly by them on the highway.
          He goes around to his oldest daughter's door and pulls ANNIE
          from the car. They stand behind the car and go at it with the
          traffic flying by. ABEL is louder than he has been in the
          entire film. He is losing it from all the pressure but his
          daughter bears the brunt.

          this. He then switches, he has had enough and gets right up
          in her face.

           option for me. I lived in
           reality... not whatever this world

           people stay warm... which isn't all

           Maybe you've got grander ambitions
           but for now this is how you eat,
           sleep, and get all dressed up... So
           you better shape the fuck up and
           NEVER speak to me like this again!

          The camera moves slowly across a dark hallway. We hear the
          sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away. As we come
          through the doorway we see ANNA MORALES sitting at her desk
          in a pool of light from the desk lamp. She is deep in it
          crunching numbers. Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he
          looks exhausted.

          gets in the front seat. JULIAN gets into the back and looks
          over at ABEL who is sitting next to him. They drive off and

          couple beats JULIAN has a look on his face that he may be
          getting rubbed out.
          Then off in the distance we see two cop cars. The car pulls
          up to them and stops. ABEL and the DRIVER get out of the car
          without a word, but ANDREW stays and turns around and now
          gives him a total debrief.

          them. ABEL turns around, facing the camera, and closes his
          eyes in sadness.
                         
          With ABEL in the foreground we see JULIAN make it halfway to

<b>          EXT. VARIOUS 1980'S URBAN DECAY LANDSCAPES
</b>          We are now with JULIAN again, running. But as this chase
          continues we see his face turn from fear, to desperation, to
          a creeping sense of evil. He does not know how it has come to
          this, but as he jumps down from fences and runs across
          deserted lots we see that his weakness is turning.
                         
          As he runs through some of the most bombed-out, destroyed
          sections of Queens, he just never stops. With each step his
          fear turns to... anger.

          He stops, collapses, and hides behind a blown-out building
          wall just as a COP CAR drives by. He starts to almost cry,
          but then it again becomes something else. His survival
          instinct is taking over and we are not sure what will become
          of it. Anger.

          down the hallway all alone then stops. He reaches into his
          briefcase and takes out the offer. He looks it over again.

           because he is a very talented young
           man. But there are some decisions
           that you cannot come back from. I
           need to know where he is. And I
           need him to turn himself in. His
           actions are hurting me and my
           business. And I refuse to let other
           people's weaknesses hurt me. I
           don't know how it has come to this,
           but it has. If he does the right
           thing I will help to take care of
           his responsibilities. You and your
           family. When you see him. Tell him
           this. Please.

          And with that JULIAN comes smashing out of the tiny cabinet
          where he was hiding and knocks over ABEL. JULIAN runs to the
          front door with ABEL chasing him.
                         
          He starts flying down the stairs at top panic speed. ABEL
          follows him down half the flight and realizes it is useless.

          ABEL then looks back up the half flight of stairs and sees
          LUISA standing there in the hall. He walks back up to her in

          This sits in the room for a long beat. Everyone then shifts
          back their attention to ABEL waiting for his response.

</b>           But over the last six months
           110,000 gallons of fuel has been
           stolen from my family and I. Now
           the reason we asked Bill to get you
           all here is because the people in
           this room are the only people
           within two hundred miles of here
           who have the ability to purchase
           and store that kind of quantity.
           So... no matter what bullshit you
           have been telling each other one of
           you... or two... or three... has
           been allowing this to happen by
           buying this from these cowards or
           worse yet hiring these guys just to
           do it. And profiting from it. So
           what I am saying is... Stop! Now.
           Have some pride in what you do and
           stop.

          drivers who are out. They are underneath the Brooklyn Queens
          Expressway in stop and go traffic.
                         
          Suddenly a panic stricken VOICE blasts through on the radio.

</b>           Eddy? Eddy?
                         
          ABEL looks up at the street where they are and realizes this
          is going down right down the street from them. He's had
          enough.
                         
          He pulls across the intersection and heads down a street. He
          comes to the next intersection and right in front of him the
          truck comes flying by.
                         
          He looks to his right and sees EDDY standing at the side of
          the road. But he wants to end this. So he pulls out and
          starts following the truck leaving EDDY behind.
                         
          ABEL follows the truck for several blocks through the
          industrial neighborhood. He is tempted to pull up alongside
          of it to see who is driving but doesn't. He continues to
          follow him.

          They get to a light and the truck makes a right hand turn
          and, as they are turning, LOUIS SERVIDIO who is sitting in
          the passenger seat looks behind him and sees that ABEL is
          following him. It now turns into a high speed chase as the
          driver steps on it.
                         
          They race down a ramp into a railyard. ABEL chases the truck
          as it crosses the tracks and heads towards an abandoned
          tunnel. The truck races into the tunnel and ABEL follows. The
          truck is throwing up a dust storm and ABEL has a difficult
          time seeing where he is going but he keeps up.
                         
          The roadway is very bumpy and both the truck and ABEL'S car
          are thrown around and the truck almost hits the sides of the
          tunnel.
                         
          The light at the end of the tunnel starts to appear through
          the dust but we can't see the truck. As ABEL comes into the
          light he has to SLAM on his brakes because the TRUCK has
          flipped over in front of him.
                         
          As he gets out of his car he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO jumping down
          from the overturned cab and run off into the train yard. ABEL
          looks at the crushed cab of the truck and sees the DRIVER has
          been killed. There is a gun sitting on the dash of the truck
          and ABEL looks and thinks. He then picks up the gun and
          chases after LOUIS SERVIDIO.
                         
          In the distance he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO leave the yard and
          head up into an elevated subway station.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

          ABEL runs up the stairs of the station and hops onto a
          leaving train just as the doors shut. ABEL looks around.
          There are three people in his car. It is covered in graffiti.
          He starts making his way down to the end of the train where
          the guy is.
                         
          He looks into the last car and sees LOUIS SERVIDIO and just
          bull rushes him to the ground. He starts beating on him very,
          very badly with the pistol. All the rage comes out of him. He
          then aims the gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO.
                         
<b>                          LOUIS SERVIDIO

<b>                          LOUIS SERVIDIO
</b>           This was it anyway. Okay... Okay.
          ABEL looks right through him and then finally lowers the gun
          and releases his hands from around his jacket and he gets up
          and looks back at ABEL.
                         
<b>           LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D)
</b>           Thank you.
                         
          LOUIS SERVIDIO then runs out of the car as the door opens.
          ABEL sits up and slows his breathing down. Finally he looks
          around the trashed car and sees that a woman has been in the
          car with them the whole time and she is just staring at him.

</b>           I'm sorry. You gave me a very good
           chance. Right?
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Probably a better chance than I
           deserved.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           No.
                         
<b>                          JULIAN
</b>           Please take care of my family.

</b>           Julian.

</b>           Please...
                         
          ABEL looks at him trying to read where this poor kid is at.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I will.
                         
          With that JULIAN takes the gun and puts it in his mouth and
          pulls the trigger.
                         
          The gun goes off and the red blood sprays on the white side
          of the fuel tank that is behind him.
                         
          ABEL and the rest are left totally in shock. They are beside
          themselves. But out of the corner of his eye ABEL notices
          that the bullet has also pierced through the tank and amid
          the red spray a flow of black heating oil is pouring out
          through the bullet hole onto the ground.
                         
          ABEL steps around JULIAN'S body and goes over to the hole. He
          picks up an old rag from the ground and stuffs it into the
          hole plugging the flow of oil.

          ABEL turns and looks back at him.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           We call the police.
                         
<b>                          ANDREW WALSH

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes!
          With that he walks off behind the tanks.
                         
                         
<b>          EXT. PARKING LOT, NEXT TO THE TANK FARM SITE - DAY
</b>                         
          There are now POLICE VEHICLES everywhere. ABEL is standing
          off alone. The DA gets out of a car all alone and walks over
          to ABEL.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I'm very sorry. Did you know him
           well?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I did.
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           He must have been under a hell of a
           lot of pressure.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yeah. For a while I thought he

</b>           I'm sorry.
                         
          They look out across the city.
                         
<b>                          ABEL

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           Yes... so you are chasing down

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I was right there... I couldn't
           help myself.
                         
          LAWRENCE nods approval.

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           Probably not.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Well, thank you for coming. I
           wanted to make sure this was
           handled correctly.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           Of course.

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           Yeah.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           So... I should tell you that I
           won't be able to take that deal you
           offered. There is no way I would
           ever accept a felony charge for
           anything we've done.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I know.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           I am not a felon.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           That's probably true.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           But I also can't have you digging
           around my life and keeping this
           hanging around my neck for the next
           ten years. I love fighting a good
           battle but this... it's very bad
           for my business.
                         
          This gets Lawrence's attention.

<b>                          ABEL (CONT'D)
</b>           So, we need to come to some sort of
           conclusion.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           We can probably do that.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Good.
          They both look out for a beat.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I hear you closed on this terminal

</b>           It looks that way.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           I didn't realize that you had that
           in the works.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           For a very long time.
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           That will put you in quite a

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Within my business it has that
           potential.
                         
          LAWRENCE shifts his tone ever so slightly.

</b>           If you get this place up and

           politically speaking.
                         
          ABEL picks up on the word POLITICALLY and stares down

<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes.

<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           And sometimes we need help to get
           there... You've come a very long
           way.
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes, I have.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           In a very short time.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           It doesn't feel that way... But
           please know that I have always
           chosen the path that was the most
           right.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           The most right?
                         
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           Yes.
                         
<b>           A.D.A. LAWRENCE
</b>           That one makes my head hurt a
           little.
<b>                          ABEL
</b>           The result is never in question for
           me. Just what path do I take to get
           there. And I have never questioned
           my path. There is always one that
           is most right. And that is what
           this is.

</b>           I hope so.
