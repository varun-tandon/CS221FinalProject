1      ...wiped off by ANDY SACHS, 20's, pretty but not glamorous,            1
       smart but green, hair up in a towel, brushing her teeth. We
       intercut ANDY getting ready and...

       ... we see three or four other GIRLS getting ready too.

1A     A drawer filled with about forty lipsticks slides into                1A
       frame... One of the GIRLS carefully applies shiny lip gloss
       with a brush... ANDY puts on cherry Chapstick...

1B&amp;C   A lacy thong floats through the air... one of the GIRLS pulls        1B&amp;C
       it up her glossy legs... A comfy cotton pair of Jockey
       bikinis is tugged out of a pile... ANDY pulls them on...

1D     A gorgeous pair of slingback heels. One of the GIRLS pulls            1D
       the shoes on while her model handsome boyfriend reclines on
       crisp white sheets, watching her.

1E     A pair of comfortable wedges... ANDY dresses while NATE,              1E
       rumpled, unshowered, wearing an old Alice in Chains t-shirt,
       watches her, reclining in mismatched bed-in-a-bag sheets...

1F&amp;G   A series of quick cuts... ANDY eats a full breakfast -- eggs,        1F&amp;G
       bacon, bagel... One of the GIRLS carefully counts out seven
       almonds and pours a huge cup of black coffee...

1H&amp;I   ANDY straightens a pile of newspaper clips from the Daily            1H&amp;I
       Northwestern with the byline ANDREA SACHS and proudly tucks
       them into her hideous college-graduation-present briefcase...
       One of the GIRLS takes Listerine breath strips, keys and a
       Gucci moneyclip and shoves everything in a tiny Fendi clutch.

       The GIRLS, looking flawless, fold their legs into taxis and
       town cars as ANDY trots down the street and into the subway.

       ANDY strides into an office building, confident. A GUARD
       stops her. Indicates she sign his clipboard. She signs in.

    ANDY runs, but she's moving against the pedestrian tide. We
    widen out to see ANDY, bucking the flow like a salmon going
    upstream.

    She gets to an intersection, starts to cross the street...

    ...and just misses being decked by a bike messenger.

    ANDY sees a tower looming in front of her. Elias-Clarke.

    Streaming into the building are the polished GIRLS we saw in
    the opening... their heels click-clack on the concrete...

    They are the CLACKERS of Elias-Clarke. ANDY runs in.

    ANDY is a shrub in a CLACKER forest. One turns to another.

</b>                 You look awesome today. I can't wear

    ANDY looks at them, then down at herself. If they're fat,
    what am I? Ding! Elevator opens and ANDY exits.

    ANDY sits across from SHERRY, 40's. On the wall are covers
    from the Elias-Clarke magazines -- a news magazine, a cooking
    magazine, a fitness magazine... and Runway.

    ANDY is unloading clips from her horrible briefcase.

     Sleek, elegant, hard-edged chic. Behind the reception desk is
     an elegant logo that says RUNWAY. ANDY walks over.

     (EMILY (and MIRANDA, later) pronounce ANDREA Ahn-DRAY-a. ANDY
     refers to herself as AN-dree-a.)

     ANDY turns and sees a taller, thinner and, amazingly, more
     groomed CLACKER. This is EMILY. She looks the part of the
     sleek fashionista, but is propelled by a core of barely
     tamped down anxiety. She examines ANDY.

                  two girls after only a few weeks. We
                  need to find someone who can survive
                  here. Do you understand?

                  You didn't just ask me that. She's the
                  editor in chief of Runway. Not to
                  mention a legend. Work a year for her
                  and you can get a job at any magazine
                  you want. A million girls would kill
                  for this job.

     She smiles. EMILY tries to think how to break it to her.

                  interested in fashion?

     EMILY gives her a look. ANDY smiles, like she has no idea
     what EMILY could mean.

     Suddenly, EMILY'S Blackberry goes off. She gasps.

     MIRANDA gestures impatiently. EMILY hands her the clipboard.
     MIRANDA peruses it as they walk down the hall.

     ANDY'S cell phone rings, shrill, annoyingly upbeat. She feels

     A pasta bar. Deserted.

     A pizza station. Not a soul.

     A salad bar. Girls crowd the lettuce area, though no one's
     within a mile of the dressing region.

     ANDY races over to the deserted soup station. Quickly ladles
     some corn chowder into a bowl. NIGEL walks by with his tray.

     ANDY dips a piece of bread in her chowder, eats it. Seeing

                You write for every magazine I love. I

                errors and a penchant for
                confessional semi-fiction that borders
                on self-indulgent.

       ANDY walks in, curious. And scared. ANDY steps into the

</b>                    Wait. You want ME to -- oh, no. No,

       MIRANDA stares. Doesn't care.

      ANDY walks downtown alone, thinking. Walks by a newsstand

      surrounded by her parents, her relatives, her friends.

      The desks outside MIRANDA'S office are empty. We hold for a
      few beats.

      Then ANDY comes in, walking slowly, still unsure.

      And at that moment MIRANDA appears. They look at each other.

      MIRANDA nods, almost imperceptibly. ANDY nods back.

      And MIRANDA takes her coat off. ANDY holds out her arms to
      take the coat from her.

      But MIRANDA puts the coat on EMILY'S desk instead. Right in
      front of EMILY'S Arc de Triomphe screensaver.

      And then MIRANDA strides into her office. ANDY sits down,
      trying to grasp the magnitude of what just happened. And just
      then MIRANDA pokes her head back in.

      And that's when EMILY steps into the street without looking.
      The second she steps off the sidewalk--

      Blam! EMILY is hit by a taxi.

      We see her purse, her cell phone, her shopping bags, some of

                 did. And at first they're always proud

                 woman. That's what they say. But

                    all the editorial content.
                        (off ANDY'S stunned look)
                    Are you really surprised? Jacqueline
                    is a lot younger than Miranda. Has a
                    fresher take on things. Not to mention
                    that American Runway is one of the
                    most expensive books in the business.
                    Jacqueline does the same thing with a
                    lot less money. Irv is a businessman,
                    you know.

                    her whole life. He can't do that to

       We see EMILY, back at her desk. The camera widens out so we

       And just then something catches MIRANDA'S eyes. ANDY,
       watching her. They look at each other.

       A beat.

       And then ANDY nods her head -- in thanks, in salutation, and
       in farewell...

       But MIRANDA does not react. She gets into the car.

       ANDY shakes her head. That's MIRANDA. She smiles, then turns
