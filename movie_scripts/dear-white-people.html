               predominately white students of
               Manchester University has resulted
               in rioting and property damages.

2A   KURT FLETCHER, 21, white. No sympathy in his jaded blue      2A

               calling for Fairbanks' resignation,
               that may have been pre-mature.

     eaten alive in a tank of sharks.

     As Lionel gets to the door of a large Colonial style home he
     checks his pockets. He's missing something. Shit.

     Lionel dials on his cell and we hear the PHONE RING from
     inside. Voicemail pops on with a voice other than Lionel's.

</b>               Kurt. It's Lionel. I'm locked out.

     As Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he
     unfolds the flyer he was just handed. It's a rendering of Sam
     White on a carton of milk with the caption:

     bohemian and radical.

     Troy glares at Sam's picture on the book. It's on. There's a

     Lionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out
     to..

     ...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself
     amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he
     trades "No Homo's" with the others.

     Lionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud
     gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his
     hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing.

                   (comes to mind)
               So the other day, a girl had the
               nerve to fix her mouth and ask me
               if my hair was weaved.
                   (after a moment)
               Weaved. Weaved bitch?

               weave. Noun. Present tense. Second
               of all don't assume just because
               you see a sister with some hair
               it's a weave. Is it? Clearly. If a
               bitch could grow straight Indian
               hair directly out her own head I
               wouldn't have just overdrafted my
               account paying for this shit but
               that ain't your business. Are those
               your lips sweetie? Sweet heart is
               that really your skin? These white
               girls and these tans I swear to
               God, they're starting to look
               darker than me.

     They reach the front of Lionel's house. George runs his hand
     through Lionel's hair. Mitch, smoking on the porch with some
     other kids - trade glances.

     Mitch and company.

      Puzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia
      just turns and walks away. Troy watches her go just as...

      ...Lionel passes by. The two share an awkward glance before
      Troy turns to enter the house.

      Lionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. He
      turns to see Troy behind him. The two avoid the other's gaze.

      As they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that
      they're headed in the same direction.

      Lionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it
      with a key. Troy's already at the door when he looks up and
      realizes Lionel's just entered his apartment.

     different cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past

     gladly shakes Kurt's hand.

     in the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining
     hall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt.

     Troy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the
     humiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall.

     Lionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the
     other side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam
     briefly who shares the same smirk.

     He realizes Sam's actually looking at Reggie, perched behind
     him at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him.

      Sam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank's last words resonate
      more than she'd like.

      Gabe, making his way outside just catches her exit.

      Huge canvas signs with the words "WHITES ONLY" are strewn
      about the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs.

She cuts it off and picks up a "white's only" sign.

          Good right?

Sam shrugs in the affirmative but it's too much. Reggie sees
a doubt in her eyes.

Sam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse
and comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to
her phone. Sam checks: "IT'S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME"

Sam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe
who's just happened upon the parking lot.

      Tears well up in Sam's eyes as she shakes her head no and
      heads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe.

      When Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. His tilted
      look of indignation asks her what she's doing.

76A   Lionel stares into a mirror in an ill fitting suit         76A
      combing out his unwieldy fro. He flinches in pain as he
      fluffs out each section.

76B   Coco pulls a blonde curly wig over her natural hair. She 76B
      smooths her tendrils to frame her face, almost pale with
      foundation. She begins on her eyes.

                say just makes one up, such as

76C   Sam removes the pins and the black power Afro pic holding 76C
      up her pompadour fro hair-do, and lets it fall flat around
      her ears. She takes in her image in the mirror.

      Laughter and music from the well to do event wafts outside
      while Troy dressed in a slick Armani tux hangs by the
      entrance. He smokes on Coco's one-hitter from before.

      Lionel steps out in his ill fitted suit, a camera in hand.
      The two are surprised to see each other.

                The trick is to dazzle them into
                forking over their estates just
                before they kick the bucket.

      Lionel could just leave. Instead he accepts the olive branch.

</b>          Hey, some could argue that a show
          with Whoopi Goldberg, Michael Dorn
          and Kunta Kinte himself is a pretty
          Black show.

</b>          No. No it did not. At least not in
          High School. I bet there's a statue
          of you at your High School.

Lionel sees a sadness in Troy.

<b>                    TROY (CONT'D)
</b>          So what? You're growing that out?

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          I think it's gaining sentience.

</b>          It's...out there.

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          It's like a black hole for white

     Behind Lionel, George and Annie pass by the steps to
     Gillespie.

</b>
     Lionel pauses before his old home - now filled with the chaos
     of a wild party. Lionel clears his throat and heads in.

<b>79   INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    79
</b>
     The party is dark and rambunctious. Lots of white kids in
     costume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as
     pimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack
     Obama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz.

     It's a lot for Lionel. Cups are handed to them filled with
     "Purple Drank." Everyone downs the stuff.

     Troy is being appreciated by an ancient COUPLE.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               ...my own firm. Maybe run for

</b>

      The couple smile. A buzz draws Troy's eyes to his phone -
      photos from "Dear White People" pop up in his news feed.

</b>
      Lionel watches as Gordon and other Pastiche crew nervously
      put up flyers and posters. They seem caught off guard. Lionel
      glances at the posters - it's Kurt with a large Afro wig
      mimicking Sam's "Missing Black Culture" flyers.

<b>                          LIONEL

      Coco enters the party - blinged out like Nicki Minaj. She's
      feeling herself as she's handed a drink.

      She's got eyes on her - for the first time like this at a
      party. But she sees the same thing Lionel saw.

      Her confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath
      her party face. She switches her iPhone to video mode...

                Why are white folks so obsessed
                with being Black? And why are Black
                folks so addicted to Blonde Barbie
                doll weaves? Honeys it's a strange
                symbiosis we're here to explore...

      Coco's voice cracks as she stares into her own image on her
      iPhone. She pauses it and takes a breath.

      Lionel leads George through the dense crowd towards the
      kitchen - George pulls Lionel into a hallway and into...

      Lionel's lips. Runs his fingers through Lionel's hair.

<b>                         GEORGE
</b>               Don't you dare.

     George plunges his fingers into Lionel's fro once again.
     Pulls a touch too hard.

<b>                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>               I could eat you like a Hershey's.

     This sets something off in Lionel.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               I'll be right back.

     Lionel breaks George's grasp and heads out the bathroom...

<b>     LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     ...and back out into the party. He's trapped in a nightmare
     of caricatures and reveling students. Can't breathe.

<b>     EXT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Lionel squeezes his way outside. Something goes off in his
     head as he starts walking away from the party.

     Just then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some
     friends. Looks at Lionel then at the house.

     Lionel paces the halls. His mind churns as he passes the
     dining hall. Sam and Reggie are engaged in something intense.

     The crowd starts to get live now.

     Coco continues to make her way through the party - her face
     visibly perturbed by the time she reaches the kitchen. She

<b>                    LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey...what is this?

Lionel smiles shyly. He should've known that.

Reggie, Curls, Dreads and the Bofros hang out at the front.

<b>                    DREADS
</b>          Your call then man.

<b>                    REGGIE
</b>              (to everyone)
          Alright ya'll - thanks for coming
          out tonight. Looks like Sam's not
          making it so...let's just call it.

The crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and
leave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think...

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          Uh. Excuse me. Hi. I'm Lionel. Some
          of you...none of you probably know
          me. I've never been to a meeting.
          But I just came back from a party
          on campus and I think you should
          know about it.

Lionel's nerves can be heard in his voice now. He's got the
judging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an
open laptop on a desk.

<b>                    LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>          Anybody mind if I?

Reggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up
the party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel
browses through the photos.

<b>                    LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>          I mean...I don't know. This is
          fucked up right?

<b>                    REGGIE
</b>          Alright brother. What's the plan?
<b>                                                             89.
</b>

     Lionel realizes the eyes aren't judging. They're mobilizing.
     Readying for action. Lionel steels himself.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               We go over there. Now.

<b>                         CURLS

</b>               You know you don't have a monopoly
               on being a pissed off minority.
               Latino's United is meeting across
               the hall. Asian American League
               too.

     Troy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads
     from the party. Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses.

     Shoved in between two RICH OLD WELL TO DOS at a long table
     covered in empty plates and glasses - Troy looks across to
     his father, in mid exaggerated guffaw with President
     Fletcher.

<b>                         DEAN FAIRBANKS

     Dean Fairbanks turns away. Troy ponders a moment and then--

               who'll listen about the kind of a
               school it is they're giving to?

     The Dean can feel the eyes of the Donors and the President on
     him - an outrage comes over him as he pulls Troy aside.

      Lionel sinks from this attack while his posse from BSU
      watches helplessly as the party goes back into full swing.

      Lionel turns to go and spots...

      ...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. But right
      behind George is...

      ...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed
      at the rap battle. She winks at Lionel.

      Lionel turns around - summons something from deep inside.

      Lionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of
      one of the rapper's hands.

proceeds to freestyle terribly...

          Yeah that's cool.
          I'd rather you think I'm white,
          than tap dance for you.

With that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He
then takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over.

Sparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock.

Lionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground.
Lionel's off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes
Kurt away in his defense.

Gordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT.

More equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the
party disintegrates into chaos.

Sam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera.

Art is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on
the ground. Arguments come to physical blows.

The steel in Sam's gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak?

And then she spots...

...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door.
Sam's camera and mic stay trained on Coco.

     Lionel spits in Kurt's face and pops right back up again. We
     see it in his eyes - he'll never give up.

     Kurt's hand is on Lionel's collar. He pushes him down again.
     Kids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche -
     some from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back.

     Lionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt's eyes.
     Lionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard.

     Kurt's in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him.

     Lionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as
     well. No time to soak this in though. Kurt's let up. For a
     moment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the
     face. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support.

     The shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out.

     The world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort
     of makes out that Kurt is yanked off him.

     Gabe nods. Sam's normal defenses come back up lest she cries.

</b>               So anyway. I didn't mean to say all

</b>               I don't know. Lunch?

     Gabe starts to walk with her.

     Gabe smiles. They walk a bit. Then he grabs her hand. Sam
     lets the moment happen. Squeezes his back. They look into
     each others' eyes.

     Don't even notice as Reggie and the Bofros pass them by.

          shooting for an episode takes. We
          recommend you cut your course load
          in half to accommodate the
          schedule.

<b>                    HELMUT
</b>          Trust me it it'll read "full-time"
          in the episode. If...once we go to
          series, we might have to figure out
          a summer schedule.

Coco stares at the contract and back at Helmut.

     Coco exits a building and spots Troy up ahead. He's flanked
     by his former enemies turned supporters, Reggie and the other
     BoFros. They all carry Troy's "New Hope" posters.

     shares a glance with Reggie, who doesn't approve.

      Coco's eyes shift longingly as she walks ahead - unsure of
      who she is at the moment and who she will be in the next.

      Watching her is Lionel and Sam - sitting with Gabe and
