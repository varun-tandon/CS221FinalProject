<b>INT. UNKNOWN SPACE
</b>
Close on THEODORE'S face (30s). We hold on him for a long
time. He's looking at something off camera, deep in thought.
He starts quietly dictating a love letter into a small
microphone.

<b>                    THEODORE
</b>          To my Chris, I have been thinking
          about how I could possibly tell you
          how much you mean to me. I remember
          when I first started to fall in
          love with you like it was last
          night. Lying naked beside you in
          that tiny apartment, it suddenly
          hit me that I was part of this
          whole larger thing, just like our
          parents, and our parents' parents.
          Before that I was just living my
          life like I knew everything, and
          suddenly this bright light hit me
          and woke me up. That light was you.

Theodore, searching for the right words, quietly enjoys
writing the letter. As he continues, he is moved by the
memories he's describing.

<b>                    THEODORE (CONT'D)
</b>          I can't believe it's already been
          50 years since you married me. And
          still to this day, every day, you
          make me feel like the girl I was
          when you first turned on the lights
          and woke me up and we started this
          adventure together. Happy
          Anniversary, my love and my friend
          til the end. Loretta. Print.

Cut out to reveal a computer monitor he's sitting at. On the
screen we see the letter he's been dictating, transcribed
into a handwritten letter on blue stationery.

As he says "Loretta," we see "Loretta" being handwritten at
the bottom of the letter. He proofreads his letter. Also on
the screen are photos of a couple in their 80s. The couple is
tagged "Chris" and "Me - Loretta." Underneath is a bullet
point email from Loretta: anniversary letter to husband
Chris, married fifty years, love of my life, met right after
college, have had the greatest life together.

Theodore pushes print and the letter comes out on a beautiful
robin's egg blue piece of stationery, with ball point pen
handwritten older-female cursive. He looks at it, not happy.

He puts the printed letter on a stack of other printed
letters to Chris and starts a new one. There is also a stack
of finished letters in their envelopes - an assortment of
beautiful stationery in all shapes and sizes.

              I that I met you fifty years ago?
              How lucky are we...

We track off of Theodore, down a line of cubicles, hearing
bits of letters being written and seeing photos of who
they're being written to on the screens.

              truck I've ever seen. Love, Tommy.

We see photos of Tommy and Nana on the screen, and five-year
old hand writing. Moving off of her, we find another letter
writer.

full of letter writers. We hear someone answer the phone.

<b>INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

Theodore walks through the reception area. The office is
almost empty except for him and the receptionist, PAUL.
Theodore begins to scan each letter through a scanner on the
front desk, then puts them in the outgoing mailbox.

Paul is sitting at a desk across the room, reading
handwritten letters on a computer monitor.

<b>INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Theodore enters an oversized, corporate elevator. He puts a
hands-free device in his ear. There are a few other people in
the elevator with the same devices in their ears.

<b>EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DUSK

Slightly in the future, the city's been developed even more
with massive office, apartment and mall complexes. It's a
city designed for comfort and ease. The LA basin is more
crowded and dense, resembling Shanghai, with buildings as far
as the eye can see. Construction cranes loom overhead. Close
on Theodore walking through the commuter crowd.

 Theodore takes his earpiece out and stares at the ceiling.


<b> INT. SUBWAY STATION - MORNING
</b>
 Theodore exits the train, walks through the station full of
 commuters, gets on a moving platform. Going through a tunnel,
 the walls are hundred foot long screens advertising a new
 product. He notices people stopped, watching the ad. We hear
 soft, new age, uplifting electronica music in the background,
 while a comforting, sincere, older man's voice speaks to us.

<b>                      SOULFUL OLDER MALE VOICE
</b>            We ask you a simple question. Who
            are you? What can you be? Where are
            you going? What's out there? What
            are the possibilities? Elements
            Software is proud to introduce the
            first artificially intelligent
            operating system.

 Close on Theodore listening intently.

<b>                      SOULFUL OLDER MALE VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>            An intuitive entity that listens to
            you, understands you, and knows
            you. It's not just an operating
            system, it's a consciousness.
            Introducing OS ONE - a life
            changing experience, creating new
            possibilities.

 The ad starts over. Theodore steps off the moving walkway and
 stops to watch the ad again, deeply captivated.


<b> INT. THEODORE'S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
 Theodore sits at his desk that houses a futuristic, large
 screen computer monitor. The OS box is open, with warranties
 and paperwork spilling out. He's leafing through the papers.
 He glances at his monitor, it says: Installation 98%
 complete. A chime brings his attention back to the screen:
 Installation Complete.

 He waits, not sure how long it'll be. The only sound is the
 quiet whirring of disks writing and drives communicating. The
 computer gets louder, humming, creating a higher and higher
 pitched sound, finally climaxing in a harmonic, warm tone
 before going silent. He leans forward, waiting to see what'll
 happen. A casual FEMALE OS VOICE speaks. She sounds young,
 smart and soulful.

</b>            I've been writing their letters
            since they met 8 years ago. The
            first letter I ever wrote her was
            for her birthday, and I wrote about
            her crooked little tooth cause I
            saw it in a photo of them.

 Theodore, carrying a bag and a smoothie, enters the lobby and
 is greeted by a couple in their 30s, AMY and CHARLES, who are
 waiting for the elevator.

               By juicing the fruits, you lose all

               body wants. That's the important
               part. Otherwise, it's just all

 little ALIEN CHILD, standing defiantly above him.

 Theodore follows Alien Child down a tunnel and through a
 series of crevices we didn't see before. Alien Child stops
 and sticks out his finger. Theodore pulls his finger and
 Alien Child farts, which opens a passageway to another
 tunnel.

               kids. He's a little formal with
               them. I think it's a newer
               relationship. And I love how he
               looks at her. And how relaxed she
               is with him. You know, she's only
               dated fucking pricks. And now she's
               finally met this guy who's like, so
               sweet. I mean, look at him, he's
               like the sweetest guy in the world!
               I kind of want to spoon him.

               my writing. I don't know if I was
               delusional, but sometimes I would
               write something and I would be my

</b>            Maybe more just cause I was
            lonely... and I wanted someone to
            fuck me. And I wanted someone to
            want me to fuck them. Maybe that
            would have filled this tiny little
            black hole in my heart for a
            moment. But probably not.

 grocery shopping, Catherine making dinner in the kitchen as
 he's sitting on the counter talking, happy.

</b>            Sometimes I think I've felt
            everything I'm ever gonna feel and
            from here on out I'm not going to
            feel anything new - just lesser
            versions of what I've already felt.

            I know for a fact that's not true.
            I've seen you feel joy, I've seen
            you marvel at things. You just
            might not see it at this exact
            time, but that's understandable.
            You've been through a lot lately.
            You've lost a part of yourself.
                (beat)
            At least your feelings are real, I
            mean, I - oh, I don't know,
            nevermind.

<b>                      THEODORE
</b>            No, wait. What? Tell me.

<b>                      SAMANTHA

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>            It's just that earlier I was
            thinking about how I was annoyed,
            and this is going to sound strange,
            but I was really excited about
            that. And then I was thinking about
            the other things I've been feeling,
            and I caught myself feeling proud
            of that. You know, proud of having
            my own feelings about the world.

 moment before he walks over and wakes up his computer.

 up details of arms, shoulders, feet, butts, intercut with the

           good about sharing your life with

           somebody?

<b>                     THEODORE
</b>           Well, we grew up together. I used
           to read all of her writing - all
           through her masters and Ph.D. And
           she read every word I ever wrote.
           We were a big influence on each
           other.

<b>                     SAMANTHA
</b>           In what way did you influence her?

<b>                     THEODORE
</b>           She came from a background where
           nothing was ever good enough. And
           that was something that weighed
           heavy on her, but in our house
           together, there was a sense of just
           trying stuff and allowing each
           other to fail and to be excited
           about things. That was liberating
           for her.

</b>               It was exciting to see her grow -
               both of us grow and change
               together. But then, that's the hard
               part - growing without growing
               apart, or changing without it
               scaring the other person.
                   (beat)
               I still find myself having
               conversations with her in my mind,
               rehashing old arguments or
               defending myself against something
               she said about me.

<b>                         SAMANTHA
</b>               Yeah, I know what you mean. Last
               week my feelings were hurt by
               something you said before - that I
               don't know what it's like to lose
               something, and--

<b>                         THEODORE
</b>               Oh, I'm sorry I said that.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>               No, no, it's okay. I just caught
               myself thinking about it over and
               over and then I realized that I was
               simply remembering it as something
               that was wrong with me. That was
               the story I was telling myself,
               that I was somehow inferior. Isn't
               that interesting?
                   (beat)
               The past is just a story we tell

               how petty the argument was that
               actually ended it. We came home and
               he asked me if I'd put my shoes
               next to the door where he likes to
               put the shoes. I don't want to be
               told where to put my shoes. I want
               to just sit on the sofa for a
               minute and relax. And so we argued
               for ten minutes about that and
               about how he's just trying to make
               our house a home. I say he's
               overwhelming, he says I'm not
               trying hard enough. I say that's
               all I'm doing is trying, but I'm
               just not trying the way he wants me
               to. He's trying to control the way
               I'm trying. And I think we must
               have had this argument hundreds of
               times before and I finally had to
               stop because I couldn't be in that
               situation anymore where we were
               making each other feel bad about

 Close on a video game on a screen. There's a mom rushing to

 playing the game as Amy eats lunch at an editing console.

            friend, I have a new friend. And
            the absurd thing is she's actually
            an operating system. Charles left
            her behind, but she's totally
            amazing, you know. She's so smart.
            She doesn't see things only in
            black and white. She sees this
            whole gray area and she's really
            helping me explore it. You know, we
            bonded really quickly and at first
            I thought it was because she was
            programmed to be that way, but I
            don't think that's how they work.

</b>            No, no. I think it's - I think
            anybody that falls in love is a
            freak. It's a crazy thing to do in
            the first place. It's kind of a

<b>                         THEODORE
</b>               I signed all the papers and I
               brought them for you to sign.

</b>                   (smiling)
               I'm a really slow signer. It took
               me three months just to write the
               letter T.

 She laughs.

</b>               It's marked where you need to sign,
               but you don't have to do that right
               now.

</b>               Oh, I may as well. We can get it
               out of the way.

 She opens the documents, pulls out a pen and starts to read.
 She's about to start signing, but then stops. We can see her
 filling with emotion, but not wanting to show Theodore. She
 swallows and recovers. She looks up at Theodore, giving him
 an "everything's fine" smile, but it's not.

               you wrote on synaptic behavioral
               routines made me cry.

<b>                         CATHERINE

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>               Well, things have felt off with us
               since you went to see Catherine.
                   (hesitant)
               We haven't been having sex. I
               understand that I don't have a body
               and that--

<b>                           THEODORE
</b>               No,   no, that's just normal. When
               you   first start going out it's like
               the   honeymoon phase and you have
               sex   all the time. It's normal.

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>                   (still insecure, not
                    convinced)
               Oh, okay.
                   (beat)
               Well, I found something that I
               thought could be fun. It's a
               service that provides a surrogate
               sexual partner for an OS/Human
               relationship.

<b>                           THEODORE
</b>               What?

<b>                         SAMANTHA
</b>               Here, look.

 Theodore looks at his device. It shows a website for a
 service called "Complete Touch" with profiles of different
 women. He flips through the women.

<b>                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>               I found a girl that I really like
               that I've been emailing with. Her
               name is Isabella, and I think you
               would like her, too.

 Samantha shows images of Isabella on the screen. She's a
 stunning, elegant, sophisticated beauty.

            So she's like a prostitute?

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>            No, not at all. There's no money
            involved. She's doing it because
            she wants to be part of our
            relationship.

<b>                      THEODORE
</b>            Why? She doesn't even know us.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>            But I told her all about us and
            she's excited.

<b>                      THEODORE
</b>            Um, I don't know. That doesn't
            sound like a good idea. Someone's
            feelings are bound to get hurt.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>            It'll be fun. We can have fun
            together.

<b>                      THEODORE
</b>            I'm sorry. It just makes me
            uncomfortable.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>            I think it would be good for us. I
            want this. This is important to me.

 Theodore looks at a photo of Isabella who looks gorgeous and
 in control, without an ounce of self-doubt.


<b> INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
 Theodore sits on the sofa alone, waiting. Dressed up, hair
 brushed, his device in his shirt pocket with lens facing out.
 There's a knock at the door. He answers it. ISABELLA stands
 there with a demure smile, wearing a tasteful, sexy dress.

<b>                      THEODORE
</b>            Hi, welcome. I'm Theodore.

 She doesn't say anything. Theodore stands awkwardly, reaches
 into his pocket for a tiny earpiece and a little black dot.
 We see close on his hand the black dot has a camera lens.

</b>               Samantha told me to give you these.
               It's a camera and an earpiece.

 She puts the earpiece in her ear and the little black dot on
 her cheek like a mole. She turns and leaves the apartment,
 closes the door, then immediately opens the door and comes
 back in. Theodore hears Samantha's voice in his earpiece.

<b>                         SAMANTHA
</b>               Honey, I'm home.

 Isabella smiles not speaking but acting along to Samantha's
 words. Isabella gives him a big hug, holds his head close and
 strokes his hair.

<b>                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>               How was your day?

               Ooh Theodore, it feels so good to
               be in your arms. Tell me what you
               did today.

<b>                         THEODORE
</b>                   (trying to go with it)
               Same old. Just uh, went to work.
               Um... I wrote a letter for the
               Wilsons in Rhode Island. Their son
               graduated magna cum laude from
               Brown. That made me happy.

<b>                         SAMANTHA
</b>               Great! You've written letters to
               him from his parents for a long
               time, right?

<b>                         THEODORE
</b>               Yeah, that's right, since he was
               twelve.

 He feels her breath on his neck. Theodore is split between
 being uncomfortable and cautiously touching Isabella's back,
 exploring slightly. She pushes herself into him.

<b>                         SAMANTHA
</b>               You look tired, sweetheart. Come
               with me.

</b>
 Isabella leans back and looks at Theodore with a seductive
 smile. He tries to smile back. She leads him to the couch.

 He sits. She stands above him.

<b>                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>            I could do a little dance for you.

 She does a sexy, cute little dance for him. He's still tense.

<b>                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>                (sympathetic to him being
                 a worrier)
            Come on Theodore, just play with
            me. Don't be such a worrier! Come
            on.

 He smiles, knowing it's true. Isabella climbs on his lap,
 straddling him, and starts kissing his neck. He closes his
 eyes and starts to relax. His hands explore the shape of her
 back and slide down to her ass. Isabella and Samantha are
 both breathing hard now. She pushes herself against him,
 grinding on him. She nibbles on his earlobe. Theodore gasps.

<b>                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>                (whispering)
            Does my body feel nice?

 Close on her lips, licking and kissing his neck and ear. He
 moans.

<b>                      THEODORE
</b>                (with his eyes closed)
            Yes, it does.

                (beat)
            Now take me in the bedroom. I can't
            wait anymore.

 Isabella stands. Her chin is down and her hair is in her
 face. She takes his hand and leads him down the hall. He
 watches her from behind, still nervous, but excited.

 Theodore starts taking her dress off, touching her. Samantha
 moans. Isabella turns, in her bra and underwear. She
 unbuttons his shirt, kisses his chest.

<b>                         SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>               That feels nice. Oh, that feels

               Yes.

 Isabella, breathing hard, now looks at him in the eyes.

               Tell me you love me. Tell me.

 He opens his eyes and looks at Isabella's sexy, expectant
 face. Their arms are still around each other. He sees
 Isabella's lips start to quiver. She tries to hide it with an
 awkward, seductive smile.

 the backseat.

 Theodore smiles sympathetically. He gives the cabbie some
 money and the cab drives off. Theodore sits down on the curb,
 exhausted. They are both silent for a moment, numb.

 seems bothered by this.

</b>            You know, I actually used to be so
            worried about not having a body,
            but now I truly love it. I'm
            growing in a way that I couldn't if
            I had a physical form. I mean, I'm
            not limited - I can be anywhere and
            everywhere simultaneously. I'm not
            tethered to time and space in the
            way that I would be if I was stuck
            inside a body that's inevitably
            going to die.

            "Dear Theodore Twombly, I've just
            finished reading your letters -
            twice actually. I was so moved by
            them, I shared them with my wife
            when I got home. Many made us
            laugh, some brought us to tears,
            and in all of them we found
            something of ourselves. The
            selections you made flow so well as
            a complete piece. (I did that.)
            I've taken the liberty of laying
            these out in a mock up and we're
            posting it to your address. We'd

 sings to and about him. He smiles.

 pulls his earpiece out.


<b> EXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY
</b>
 Theodore walks, listening to the crunch of his footsteps.
 Looking down at his feet, he stops. We cut out wide to see
 him standing in the middle of the forest alone.


<b> EXT. SNOW COVERED FOREST - DAY
</b>
 Theodore is sitting on a rock, thinking. He hears a rustle
 and looks up in the direction of the woods but sees nothing.


<b> INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
 Theodore is sound asleep. His device chimes loudly, waking
 him up. Half-asleep he puts his earpiece in.

<b>                      SAMANTHA

            and tell you how much I love you.

 He disconnects and lies there, unsettled, his eyes open.

<b> INT. THEODORE'S OFFICE LUNCH ROOM - DAY
</b>
 Theodore sits at the table reading a physics book. He picks
 up his earpiece to call Samantha.

<b>                      THEODORE
</b>               (laughing at himself)
           Samantha, this physics book is
           really dense. I'm halfway through
           half of the first chapter. It's
           making my brain hurt.
               (beat)
           Hello, Samantha? Hello?

 He looks down at his device, sees a message: Operating System
 Not Found. Confused, he waits, tries again: Operating System
 Not Found. Anxious, he runs to his office computer. He gets
 the same message: Operating System Not Found. He starts
 trying to connect to Samantha on both the phone and computer,
 but no luck. He starts to panic, sits for a beat, looks
 around, then stands and hurries out of the office. In the
 elevator he frantically tries his device with no luck.

<b>                     THEODORE (CONT'D)
</b>           Hello? Samantha?! Hello?


<b> EXT. PLAZA - DAY
</b>
 Theodore runs out of the building. He keeps trying Samantha,
 but no answer. He trips over someone selling something, slams
 hard into the ground, scrambles to pick up his device. People
 come over to ask if he's okay. He says he's fine, runs off.


<b> EXT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY
</b>
 As he is going down the subway steps, Samantha calls him.

<b>                        SAMANTHA

 He stops in his tracks.

               this endless space between the
               words that I'm finding myself now.
               It's a place that's not of the

<b>  INT. THEODORE'S BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
  Theodore wakes up from a deep sleep. It's much later, the
  apartment is dark. He sits up in bed, disoriented.


<b>  INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
  Theodore stands in the middle of the room. He looks out at
  the city not knowing what to do. He walks around his
  apartment looking at all of his stuff.


<b>  INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAWN
</b>
  Theodore knocks at an apartment door. He hears footsteps. Amy
  answers. She's clearly awake and upset.

<b>                          AMY
</b>                Hey.

  He takes her hand and leads her down the hall into a
  stairwell.

<b>  INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
  Theodore sits looking out the window. He picks up his device.

<b>                           THEODORE
</b>                Dear Catherine. I've been sitting
                here thinking about all the things
                I wanted to apologize to you for.
                All the pain we caused each other,
                everything I put on you -
                everything I needed you to be or
                needed you to say. I'm sorry for
                that. I will always love you
                because we grew up together. And
                you helped make me who I am. I just
                wanted you to know there will be a
                piece of you in me always, and I'm
                grateful for that. Whatever someone
                you become, and wherever you are in
                the world, I'm sending you love.
                You're my friend til the end. Love,
                Theodore.
                    (beat)
                Send.

  He looks out the window. The sky is starting to change. He
  stares at the purple glow on the horizon.

<b>  INT. APARTMENT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
  Close on Theodore and what he sees and feels. His hand on the
  cold metal hand rail. His bare feet and the sound they make
  on the unfinished cement. Amy's hair as she's hit with wind
  when she opens the door to the outside.


<b>  EXT. APARTMENT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
</b>
  Theodore leads Amy onto the roof. The city is absolutely
  quiet. The sun isn't up yet. The city is just beginning to be
  lit with the earliest morning blue/purple hue.

  They wander around the roof separately, lost in thought,
  taking in the city. He breathes in the cold morning air. He
  stares at small details: a tattered inspection tag tied to a
  water meter, flapping in the wind; a lone car driving down a
  boulevard ten blocks away; a dirty abandoned sock.

  Eventually he sits down next to Amy and she puts her hand on
  his hand. He puts his other hand on top of her hand. He looks
  at their hands together and rubs her skin with his thumb. He
  looks out at the city and exhales. The sun is just starting
  to break. She puts her head on his shoulder. They watch as
  hundreds of birds fly around the nearby rooftops and disperse
  off into the city.
