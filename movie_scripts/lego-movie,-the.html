          Suddenly, we are blinded by a powerful TUNNEL OF LIGHT.
          It's an animated LEGO version of the light tunnel in
          2001, which was directed by Stanley Kubrick, who knows a

          REVEAL LEGO INDIANA JONES and two GUIDES. Indy puts up a
          hand for them to stop. He removes a RUBY RED PIECE from
          his bag and connects it to the temple. The piece GLOWS.
                         
          A dark passageway opens, and Indy lights a torch. The
          flames are made of ANIMATED LEGO BRICKS. The guides are

          from every ancient civilization imaginable.
                         
          Indy carefully lifts a tablet from a statue of Zeus and
          places it into the sarcophagus like an ATM card. He
          pushes a bunch of cuneiform buttons - a PIN NUMBER.
                         
          The sarcophagus opens. A white-hot glow on Indy's face.
                         
          BLAM!!! The entire room shakes. The statues are blown
          apart!
                         
          The smoke clears. Enter THE BLACK FALCON, the most evil

          The BF motions and his guards carry the sarcophagus away.

          He exits. As the sarcophagus crosses the threshold of
          the temple, walls shake. The temple is CRUMBLING.
                         
          Left for dead, Indy uses the falling pieces to build
          himself a sweet rocket ship and blasts out of the temple.
          Narrowly avoiding a big rolling LEGO ball, probably.

          from the highest height. It's beautiful. He's downright
          INSPIRED looking at it. He sees the LEGO brick clouds in

           breathing. The world was messy and

           just stopped thinking of new
           things. Making has been outsourced
           to Empura. The Black Falcon has
           paved over the world that was.

          the side facing the building is an 8-bit image of the
