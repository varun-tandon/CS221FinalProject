    An AVALANCHE of SOUNDBITES, colliding and overlapping. Coming
    so fast, we can barely process them. A virtual sound book...

<b>    WAR ON DRUGS. NANCY REAGAN. CRACK. DARYL GATES. CRIPS &amp;

    All these images add up to a minute and a half recap of not
    just black history but American history. As soon as they're
    done, we find ourselves plunged into --

    A bucket pulls up in front of a shitty-looking BROWN HOUSE
    with ugly bars on the windows and doors. A rusted swing-set
    leans sideways on the dirt/grass they call a front lawn.

</b>
    Inside the car is ERIC WRIGHT, 21, but you know him as --

<b>    SUPERIMPOSE: ERIC WRIGHT AKA EAZY-E
</b>
    A man who is completely in his element -- comfortable and
    poised, ready for anything.

    He hops out of the car, moves quickly to the TRUNK -- pops it
    open and reaches inside. With an electric screwdriver, Eazy
    unscrews a CERWIN-VEGA sub-woofer. Grabs a bulging BROWN BAG
    out of the speaker... and a 9mm -- SLAMS the trunk.

    ON THE ROOF, a LOOKOUT clocks Eazy as he walks up to the
    front door of the decrepit house...

    Eazy KNOCKS BY CODE. A dude, TONE (20s), opens a slat in the
    door. Gauges Eazy, EYES SKEPTICAL.

    It's not what you'd call "cozy." The carpet is torn up,
    stained, cigarette-burnt. Walls covered in TAGS. A PITBULL
    stares menacingly from the kitchen.

    In addition to Eazy and Tone, there are THREE other people
    spread around the room: one GIRL lounges on a vinyl couch,
    eyes glazed; another girl, TASHA, loudly SCRAPES soul food
    onto the pitbull's plate; and a JITTERY DUDE steady keeps an
    EYE out the WINDOW, tense, occasionally clocking --

    EAZY spreads the CONTENTS of the BROWN BAG before them on a
    long TABLE: three FREEZER BAGS each containing 10 ounces. He
    looks up, ALL BUSINESS.

    Tone turns to Tasha in the kitchen, nods.

<b>                        TONE
</b>              Tasha, get this dude a 40.

    TASHA opens the fridge, grabs a 40oz. --

    -- hands it to Tone who CRACKS it open. Drinks...

</b>          Dumb ass, this a dope house! It's

          Well fuck it then -- You gonna have
          to let us hold on to that right
          there.

ON THE COUCH, the GIRL grabs a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN FROM UNDER A
PILLOW. Levels it at Eazy, face grimaced, hard, strung out.

<b>                    EAZY
</b>          Yeah, do what you gotta do --
          `Cause I got my homies parked
          across the street from your momma's
          house. I don't show up. They show
          out...

Eazy just stares right back at them. The tension's like a
pressure cooker about to burst. Until --

A WHISTLE echoes in from outside (THE LOOKOUT) --

Suddenly, everyone notices a deep RUMBLING coming from
outside. Jittery Dude steps back from the window, eyes wide --

<b>                    JITTERY DUDE
</b>          Oh, shit --

Because there's a MASSIVE ARMORED VEHICLE rolling down the
street toward them. 6 TONS of steel, with a 14-foot BATTERING
RAM mounted on the front. LAPD emblazoned on the side.

<b>                    JITTERY DUDE (CONT'D)
</b>          Fuckin' Batter-Ram!

Everyone in the room FLIES into action, STASHING the WEAPONS
and the MONEY into hidden STASH SPOTS all over the HOUSE:
Behind fake-panel LIGHT SWITCHES, hidden HATCHES beneath the
FLOORBOARDS, in a fake-panel inside the FRIDGE. It's some
serious MACGYVER SHIT.

Eazy grabs his ROCKS, BEE-LINES for the BACK of the HOUSE,
eyes wide, amped on adrenaline as the RUMBLING ESCALATES to
an almost UNBEARABLE LEVEL --

CRASH!!! The 14-foot BATTERING RAM PUNCHES THROUGH THE WALL.
DEBRIS FLIES EVERYWHERE. The RAM keeps coming until --

</b>

    The GIRLS SCREAM! The ARMORED VEHICLE REVERSES, the BATTERING
    RAM POLE YANKING THE ENTIRE WALL OUT WITH IT, leaving a
    MASSIVE RAGGED HOLE where we can see --

<b>                        SQUAD CARS SWARMING INTO THE AREA,

</b>
    EAZY-E kicks out a KITCHEN window, squeezes through, hits the
    dirt on the side of the house. Sprints past --

    A PITBULL! The GROWLING DOG hustles for Eazy as a FLASHLIGHT
    hits Eazy's back, a COP giving chase!

    As they race across the back yard, the Pitbull diverts to the
    cop, who panics. He's about to get mauled until --

    ANOTHER COP pops around the corner! Blasts the dog with a
    FIRE EXTINGUISHER, filling the air with a dense cloud of
    expellant, as --

    Eazy hops on a fence, hits the garage roof and jumps in a
    neighbor's yard. Gone. He lives to slang another day...

    But the SOUNDS OF CHAOS carry over, infiltrate the inky
    black: SIRENS HOWLING. PEOPLE SHOUTING. HELICOPTERS BUZZING.
    DOGS BARKING. A mad medley that continues into --

    A PAIR OF OVERSIZED HEADPHONES, worn by ANDRE YOUNG. Better
    known as Â­-

    Eyes closed, lying on his bed, slight smile pursing his lips,
    he bobs his head as --

    WE HEAR WHAT HE HEARS, treated to the beautiful mind of Dre.
    THE SOUNDS OF CHAOS are evaporated, seemingly synthesized
    into the dope melody Dre's peacefully bobbing his head to...

    WE HEAR the multi-tracks of the song -- levels go up and down
    based on Dre's subtle FACIAL REACTIONS to the various sounds.
    He singles out INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS, and as he does, WE HEAR
    them, highlighting some sounds, decreasing others: BASS,
    DRUMS, PIANO, VOICE... It's pure instinct, pure joy. Until --
<b>                                                           5.

BAM-BAM! A fist on a locked door. The music stops as Dre
removes his headphones. We now see --

DRE'S ROOM, populated with turn tables -- one side spinning
the record he's listening to -- DJ station and a vast sea of
LPs (sure there's Parliament, but also Duke Ellington)
scattered around the room. A music junkie's paradise.

On the other bed, his brother TYREE (17) chills as Dre opens
the door to find --

<b>                    VERNA
</b>          What happened?

VERNA GRIFFIN, 36, his Mother, and she can smell bullshit a

Quick as lightning, she SNATCHES it away from him --

Dre fumes, gather the bills off the floor, heads for the
kitchen --

<b>                    VERNA
</b>          But you don't own the company.

<b>                    VERNA (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh, you think we're done here?

Dre keeps going, MUTTERS under his breath -- She grabs his
shoulder, SPINS him around, strong. Gets in his face.

<b>                    VERNA (CONT'D)
</b>          You got somethin' to say to me!?

<b>                    DRE

          You don't care what I'm fighting
          for.

I already know what I wanna do with my life, and it
definitely ain't sittin in a cubicle takin' orders on some
stupid ass job.

Verna's eyes FLASH -- WHAP! She SLAPS HIM IN THE FACE --

Dre steps back, puts his hand to his cheek. Verna's reeling
as much as he is. She tries to compose herself.

<b>                    VERNA

          off to get us here and I refuse to
          let you throw it all away.

Dre holds Verna's gaze a moment longer, then turns and calmly
walks back past her, into his room. He picks up his
headphones, pull-out car stereo. Heads for the door, opens
it...

    Dre bounds over to a battered BLUE &amp; WHITE DATSUN B-210
    parked in the DRIVEWAY, regret settling in. He looks up to
    see Tyree ambling closer, carrying a bundle of errantly-
    selected clothes, a crate of records.

    Dre rolls along   in that ugly-ass Datsun. It's still early,
    but the STREETS   are starting to FILL UP. Dudes in doorways,
    on the corners,   clocking him as he passes. An LA SHERIFF'S
    DEPT. SQUAD CAR   slides past, disappears around a corner.

    of WIND. BELOW, we see the tight grids of SOUTH LOS ANGELES,
    and the densely-packed TRAFFIC heading north along the 110
    FREEWAY, as it angles toward the SKYSCRAPERS of DOWNTOWN L.A.

    We move NORTH and there's DODGER STADIUM plunked at the
    southern tip of ELYSIAN PARK, and the LA RIVER twisting
    snakelike up into GRIFFITH PARK --

    And NORTHWEST past the mountains of Griffith, descending into

    All the way in the BACK ROW we settle on O'SHEA JACKSON, who
    we now know as --

<b>    "BORED AS HELL AND I WANNA GET ILL. SO I WENT TO THE SPOT

    He gazes out the school bus window to see that --

    In stark contrast to those on the bus, just beyond the glass
    is a sea of WHITE STUDENTS. They hang out, shoot the shit in
    their nice clothes, hop into their nice cars. It's a club
    that Cube isn't a part of and it's clear that he can feel it.

      Valley, it looks like BEIRUT out there: Graffiti tags, liquor
      stores everywhere, boarded-up shops, DUDES loitering,
      drinking, slanging. Crip throws a rock and hits the bus.

      FIND CUBE sitting halfway back, still doing his thing,

      The bus rolls to a stop. Before any KIDS can get off -- the
      O.G. Bloods' truck pulls in front of the bus, blocking the
      road. Passenger hops out.

      Noticing, the BUS DRIVER goes to shut the doors, but he's too
      late -- O.G. Blood gets on, strides past the BUS DRIVER --
      glock 9mm in hand.

<b>                          BUS DRIVER
</b>                Hey what's going on? --

<b>                          O.G. BLOOD
</b>                Shut the fuck up, Blood!
                    (Addresses the whole bus)
                You young muthafuckas wanna die
                today?!

      Everyone on the bus falls SILENT. By the shocked expression
      on the kids' faces, they have no clue how or if they're gonna
      get out of this alive.

<b>                          O.G. BLOOD (CONT'D)
</b><b>                HUH!?
</b>
      He makes his way back to the WANNABE KIDS near the
      expressionless Cube. Sensing shit is about to jump off, Cube
      slowly reaches for the WINDOW next to him, starts SLIDING IT
      OPEN. He edges closer to the window, grabs his NOTEBOOK,
      fully prepared to jump the fuck out that window.

<b>                         WANNABE KID 1
</b>               Yes.

     The O.G. Blood looks over his shoulder, scowls at all the
     terrified faces staring back at him.

<b>                         O.G. BLOOD

               Remember me! This that Crenshaw
               Mafia, Blood!

     And with that, the O.G. Blood tucks his gun, and calmly exits
     the bus -- leaving behind the stunned kids.

     Their truck pulls away into traffic.

     Cube grab his books, get up to exit the bus along with a few
     others, but not before glancing over at the kids, who sit
     there sweating, shell-shocked.

     Cube shakes his head at the wannabes. No way he's going out
     like that.

We're given tour of the sights and sounds of South Central.
The pervasive shudder of LAPD CHOPPERS TAUNT OVERHEAD, DOGS
BARKING, as an LAPD SQUAD CAR CRUISES MENACINGLY PAST like a
shark in festive waters.

Up ahead, BLOCK DUDES loiter on a neighbor's untended grass.

The Dudes laugh as Cube continues on. Keeps moving.

UP AHEAD, he sees Dre's DATSUN parked across the street. No
question where Cube's headed.

      JINX'S ROOM, dirty but very hip-hop. JINX, 17, is digging
      through a crate of RECORDS, and offering them up to DRE, who
      waves most of them away because --

      DRE'S IN THE ZONE, doing his thing on the turntables, mixing,
      SCRATCHING. And whatever it is sounds DOPE. Next-level shit.

      Dre, lost in the music, doesn't respond -- Jinx holds up two
      ALBUM COVERS: The Ohio Players' FUNKY WORM and The
      Headhunters' GOD MADE ME FUNKY. Doesn't make sense, yet --

     A Chevy Caprice cop car, light-bar strobing, has pulled
     aggressively onto the curb, all four doors open. CRASH
     OFFICERS roughly frisk the Block Dudes, as --

     School shit in hand, Cube walks past, inconspicuous as
     possible. Can't help but glance at the scene --

     Hesitant, Cube complies. Used to getting jacked by the
     police, he assumes the same position the other Block Dudes
     are in: hands on the hood, legs back.

     One of the other Crash Cops pulls out his WALKIE --

BAM! Crash Cop 1 shoves Cube against the car, kicking his
legs apart, a hand on the back of his head. Cube's NOTEBOOKS
hit the pavement -- Get trampled.

his fingers behind his head --

Block Dude 1 HOWLS in pain as Crash Cop 2 viciously SQUEEZES
his interlocked knuckles. Crash Cop 1 shoots a look to
Uniform Cop 2: Settle down, dude!

TWO MORE SQUAD CARS SCREECH onto the scene. Four UNIFORMED
POLICE climb out, to make an even bigger deal out of nothing.

Cube's Dad, HOSIE, appears up on the porch, pissed.

Hosie, shocked to see her son getting assaulted --

UNSNAPS his holster, hand grasping his pistol.

     standing near the wall: JINX and TYREE are busy clocking the
     GIRLS, but CUBE is studying a ripped-out page of LYRICS.

     ON STAGE, wearing purple satin jackets with WORLD CLASS
     WRECKIN CRU on the back, DRE spins some `80s R&amp;B while his

     through them to look like he's busy as --

     LONZO WILLIAMS, club PROMOTER and Dre's BOSS approaches. He

     Dre chuckles, immediately searches the crowd, locking eyes
     with CUBE. Dre gives him a NOD, and Cube takes a breath,
     heads toward the Stage -- Moment of truth.

     Dre hands the mic to Cube as the crowd eyeballs him with
     suspicion and restraint. They're clearly not gonna give him
     respect til he earns it. Cube steels himself, clenches his
     jaw, puffs out his chest. And time turns eternal before --

               out, Now I'm the muthafucka that ya

     After only a few lines, the crowd's CHEERING. HOLLERING.
     Dancing. An infectious vibe.

     And we DRIFT back to Eazy, standing with Ren, feeling the
     fuck out of this music, pensive look on his face. Something
     crystallizing as we --

     Yella spins a number for the crowd, who seem less energized
     now that Cube's off stage. To the side, LONZO chews out Dre --

Dre turns to find Yella up on stage in the DJ booth, mouthing
"LONZO," as he points into the crowd. Dre follows Yella's
finger, spots Lonzo slowly moving through, greeting people as
he goes.

     Tyree shoves the dude -- Dre's eyes light up! That's my
     brother! He drops his crate of records, bumrushes the Dude
     and COLD-COCKS HIM. The Dude just drops, dazed.

     Dre turns to Tyree, adrenaline pumping.

     feet just as --

     WHOOP! WHOOP! An L.A. Sheriff's Dept. SQUAD CAR rolls into
     the lot, lights on Dre, Tyree and the Dude. In a hurry, the
     two OFFICERS are out of the car, approaching the guys --

     defying the Officer. In a flash --

     car! Cuffs slapped on! Same for Tyree and the Dude as we --

     Dre. Clearly, he's not comfortable here. Hops into the car.

     levels on a hard-driving BEAT.

     A small CREW of Kangol-wearing RAPPERS (HOME BOYS ONLY, aka
     HBO) are gathered around, reading pages we recognize as
     CUBE'S LYRICS with befuddled expressions.

Nobody says a thing. Deafening silence. Then:

</b>          Then do the lyrics. We losin' time
          and I'm losin' patience.

The vibe is tense, unpleasant. Finally:

Cube and the HBO dudes square up, swelling and huffing --
Without hesitation, Eazy gets up, stands beside Cube. Dre
whips off his headphones and flanks Cube from the other side.
These dudes have each other's back, ready to throw down.

     The HBO clowns start exiting, talking shit.

     Eazy wanders back over to the couch, plops down, sighs:

     Eazy takes a breath, huddles over the mic. He puts his Locs
     sunglasses on, pulls his baseball cap low -- so low you can
     barely see him (which is exactly the point).

     Dre sits behind the board with Cube. STARTS UP THE BEAT and
     cues Eazy --

     in the air, SCREAMING, even though nothing's happened yet.
     The stage is pitch black as we see the silhouettes of NWA
     members manning their battle stations. More screams and

The guys are confused. Food in hand.

          before I shoot you! That's what you
          did!

After peeping out the cops overly aggressive posture. The
guys start to comply. Mexican food hits the ground first then
all the guys go face down-- spread eagle.

<b>                    DRE

Torrance Cop 1 starts to roughly frisk the guys.

roughly, hyper-extending his arms --

Suddenly there's a BANGING at Dre's FRONT DOOR --

door. OPENS it to find --

A BIG DUDE, standing outside, looking PISSED!

        Dre starts closing the door, and the DUDE jams his BOOT in,
        stopping Dre from closing the door.

        Big Dude pulls up his SHIRT, PISTOL poking out of his
        waistband -- Dre SHOVES him back and SLAMS the door! Quickly
        OPENS the DOOR to the adjacent room where --

47pt3   ON THE OTHER SIDE                                      47pt3

        There's a PARTY going on. EAZY, CUBE and REN are all partying
        with GIRLS, most of whom aren't wearing any shirts. Titties
        are everywhere, booze flowing freely.

        YELLA's in the middle, FUCKING A GIRL on one of the beds.

<b>                            DRE
</b>                  Yo! Any of y'all named Felicia?

<b>                            YELLA
</b>                      (to the girl under him)

<b>                            GIRL

                  nigga strapped.

        Eyes wide, Eazy quickly pulls the GUN DUFFEL out from under
        one of the beds, unzips it, fishes through and pulls out an

                  inside the hotel --

        through the crack --

      BIG DUDE is still out there, standing about 15 feet away,
      with TWO OTHER similarly-large DUDES.

<b>                          BIG DUDE
</b>                She in there or what?

<b>                          EAZY

                homeboy's got his dick in her
                mouth.

      Big Dude scowls, rests his hand on the butt of his pistol.

<b>                          BIG DUDE
</b>                What the fuck did you say?

      BACK INSIDE, Ren overhears this. Tosses a GIRL off his lap,
      grabs his 9mm from the table, COCKS it --

      IN THE HALLWAY, Eazy steps FULLY out of his room -- RACKS the
      AK and AIMS IT RIGHT AT THE 3 DUDES --

<b>                          EAZY
</b>                How bad you want Felicia now?

      The DUDES gape at Eazy a moment, then SCATTER, disappearing
      down the hallway. Eazy LAUGHS his ass off as Ren bolts out,
      9mm in hand, ready for anything --

<b>                          REN
</b>                Where they go?

AT A TABLE NEARBY, Jerry and Eazy devour steaks and lobster,
sipping champagne.

Jerry's distracted by the sight of Cube marching towards the
table, bag of McDonald's still in hand. Smiles up at him.
Eazy doesn't make eye contact.

               are, Cube. Just give us a little
               more time.

     Cube glances at Eazy, who's like a statue. Cube picks up
     Eazy's champagne glass, drains it, sets it back down.

<b>                         CUBE
</b>               Shit's pretty good. Someday, huh?

     With that, he turns and walks out. Jerry watches him go.
     Then, to no one in particular:

     But Eazy's not paying attention. Waving to a passing waiter:

     WE HEAR a FAINT VIBRATING SOUND. Dre realizes it's his PAGER.
     Grabs it off his bed. Sees that he's missed TWELVE PAGES. AND
     EVERY SINGLE ONE IS LABELED "9-1-1." Instinct in overdrive,
     he hurries to the FRONT of the bus, tells the DRIVER --

<b>                         DRE (CONT'D)

<b>52   EXT. GAS STATION - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, USA - MOMENTS LATER 52
</b>
     The BUS is parked in a nearly-empty PARKING LOT outside of a
     lonesome, isolated GAS STATION. It's a dark, starless night.

     Dre shuffles slowly out of the station, in a daze, like he
     just awoke from a fucked-up dream. He walks over to the BUS.
     But instead of getting on, he SITS DOWN on the pavement, eyes
     filled with shock and disbelief.

     The sound of FOOTSTEPS as Ren, Yella, Cube, and Eazy exit the
     bus, surround Dre. They can tell something is very wrong.

<b>                         YELLA
</b>               Yo, Dre. What's goin' on?

     ON DRE as he forces back the tears that wanna come, his voice
     barely a whisper:
<b>                                                        56.

<b>                     DRE
</b>          My Moms called. Tyree. He's dead.
          Somebody killed my little
          brother...

Shocked: "What?" "Hell naw!" "What happen?" are heard amongst
Cube, Eazy, Yella and Ren-- they crouch down next to Dre. Not
sure what else to say or do. They wait for Dre to say more...

<b>                    DRE (CONT'D)
</b>          He got into a fight near Leimert
          Park. A big mothafucka fell on top
          of him -- broke his neck. He killed
          Tyree. I can't believe this shit.

Face buried in his hands, Dre quietly weeps.

Jinx, Laylaw and DJ Speed gather in the front window of the
bus. Not wanting to interrupt the group's moment.

Cube rests a hand on Dre's shoulder as the others tighten the
circle. There's silence... until:

<b>                    CUBE

          love don't. Feel me? Tyree is
          always gonna be with you. No matter
          what.

Eazy moves closer. Slowly, he places a hand on Dre's head.
Rubs it. It's a bit startling -- Eazy's not one for
tenderness. But it's clear he feels Dre's pain.

     PULL BACK as the guys remain clustered around Dre. Looking so
     small, so vulnerable, crouched in front of the Bus, alone in
     the parking lot. NWA against the world.

     In a suit, Dre stands beside Tyree's MEMORIAL WALL, his arm
     draped around his heartbroken mother, Verna. She cries
     without end or apology, surrounded by family, including his
     other brother, WARREN G, plus Eazy, Cube, Ren and Yella.

     It's solemn and quiet. Dre remains stoic, staring hard,
     trying his best to remain strong for his mother. All members
     of the band keep a close eye on him, as the pastor wraps up
     his eulogy.

               for inciting a riot! No one cares
               that the police started it...

     Dre, Ren and Yella start paying attention as Eazy switches
     channels. Finds another report about the riot. And another.
     And another. Images blurring by of the concert.

there's EAZY's signature, DRE's, YELLA's, and REN's. Cube can
only shake his head with confusion, disappointment.

Jerry lays a CHECK on the desk in front of Cube, made out to
O'SHEA JACKSON. And it's for $75,000. Cube can't help it, his
eyes go wide. It's more money than he ever dreamed of.

      BACK WITH DRE, considering the scene as everyone drives away,
      going in separate directions:

      Cube leaves with T-Bone... Yella leaves with Ren... Eazy

      Cube rides in the passenger seat, pretty low at this point.
      No money, no group. JINX MOUTH IS RUNNING, but Cube's in a
      daze -- doesn't hear a word he's saying.

                stuff, huh? Cube? Cube?!

      As the car pulls up to a stop light, Cube looks over, spots a
      beautiful YOUNG LADY in a nice jeep on rims. She's looks back
      over at him, their eyes locked. Is this love at first sight?
      After a few magical moments. Cube finally speaks.

Bryan chuckles and looks over at Cube-- who doesn't seem in
the mood for small talk. Cube notices the CD in Bryan's hand.

     parked across the street. A very large BLACK MAN we haven't

     The room is over-crowded -- because everyone has an
     ENTOURAGE. JERRY is also there and he doesn't look thrilled
     about it, nor is he happy to see --

     SUGE KNIGHT in the room, hovering behind DRE at the Board,
     accompanied by a very large GERMAN SHEPHERD.

     Jerry tries to make his way over to Dre, but SUGE blocks his
     path, and the HUGE DOG stares at Jerry.

     Jerry looks at the dog, the dog looks back. Stymied, Jerry
     turns and exits the studio, jaw clenched.

     After he leaves, Dre sighs. He looks tired, depressed.
     Totally over it. He PLAYS BACK the track he's been working
     on, listens. Tries to feel it. But something's missing.

     Irritated, Dre gets up, exits the studio. Suge follows --

     pool. His eyes look hard, flat, broken somehow --

     JERRY, in his BATHROBE looking freaked out, holding the gun.

     leftovers from the fridge. Slides them over to Eazy. But Eazy
     isn't interested. Instead, he pulls out a bag of weed. Rolls
     a joint, lights it. Takes a long drag -- Exhales a lot more

Jerry closes his eyes, takes a breath. Tries to keep his tone
relaxed, so that he can, in turn, relax Eazy.

          Compton. We don't hit back with

Jerry puts a fatherly hand on Eazy's shoulder. Looks at him.

        The MUSIC IS BUMPIN'! There's a party going on somewhere in
        this house, but not in this room. We're close up on a pair of
        blue Chuck Taylors with a pair Dickies and boxers draped on
        them. As we pull back, we realize that some LUCKY BASTARD is
        GETTING HEAD from a SEXY WOMAN with nice curves.

        As we pull back further, we can't even see who the Lucky
        Bastard is because another AMAZING FEMALE is sitting on his
        face, MOANING and smoking a blunt. Just as we attempt to
        register what's going on --

        We track another SPECTACULAR FEMALE in a two-piece bikini.
        She grabs the blunt from her, hits it and walks out to the
        balcony. She blows out the smoke and passes it to one of the
        HOMIES who's already rolling up more blunts from the pound of
        weed sitting on the table in front of him.

        From there we crane down, passing the DJ rig on the second
        floor balcony. Even the DJ has GIRLS around him, a blunt in
        his mouth, and a drink in his hand.

        We crane down further to the bottom floor where MORE GIRLS in
        BIKINIS get sprayed by GUYS with SUPER SOAKERS and CHAMPAGNE
        BOTTLES. It's an impromptu "wet T-shirt" contest.

        As we pull back across the pool, a few more TOPLESS GIRLS
        jump in and we realize we're at one of those famous Dr.
        Dre/Death Row pool parties. People everywhere. Sex in the
        air. Freezer-bags stuffed with high-grade weed are being
        passed out to everybody by Snoop Dogg himself.

        We catch a glimpse of two nice looking LADIES walking over to
        the bar. We will come to know one of them as NICOLE. But
        first--

        IN THE GAZEBO, we find Dre smoking a blunt and playing
        DOMINOES with D.O.C., laughing, blowing off some much-needed
        steam. Until --

        Dre's eyes settle on Nicole, who's different from the rest.
        She's not drunk, or dancing, or flirting. She's beautiful,
        but in an understated way. When her friend gets up and walks
        away, Nicole turns, like she senses Dre's gaze. Looks right
        at him, with clear, bright, but wary eyes. He heads over --

          knew I should've drove.

</b>          You're not having fun?

<b>                    NICOLE
</b>          Oh no, it was fun. I had a lot of
          fun. But now it's starting to get a
          little wild.

<b>                     DRE
</b>          Yeah, it does get crazy around here
          sometimes.
              (extending his hand)

</b>          Hey Nicole, why don't you come over
          here with me and kick it for a
          while til your friend gets back.

She considers a moment. Then --

</b>          I don't know, maybe another time
          and another place. But not now.

And with that, a visibly tipsy Warren G walks over, trying to
dump some USED COALS out of a kettle-style GRILL --

<b>                    WARREN G
</b>          Yo Dre, we're can I dump this shit?

     Warren's walk off.

</b>               A friend connection?

</b>               Speaking of friends, I need to go

               to your game. I'll talk to you
               later.

     She gets up and heads off leaving Dre with a big smile on his

     tension developing.

     On one side, we have SNOOP'S CREW -- many of them straight-up
     Long Beach Rollin 20's CRIPS. While Suge's crew, on the other
     side, are various Compton BLOODS.

      Everybody SCATTERS, tripping over each other, falling on the
      lawn, because let's not forget everyone is WASTED.

      Find DRE, watching the flames, almost hypnotized by them,
      because it doesn't seem real. Warren G staggers up beside
      him, watching on, eyes like saucers.

<b>                          WARREN G
</b>                Your house is on fire.

</b>                Maybe I shouldn't have thrown them

As they walk to the other side of the studio we WIDEN TO

with a baseball cap pulled low over his eyes.

      something's different this time. Eazy doesn't just sign.
      Instead, he starts GATHERING the papers into a pile.

<b>                          JERRY
</b>                Wait, aren't you gonna sign --

</b>                I'mma take these home with me. I'll
                sign 'em. Get'em back to you in a
                couple days.

      Jerry looks alarmed.

<b>                          JERRY
</b>                But this is how we've always done it.
                You have a lot on your plate Eric,
                there's no need to add to it --

<b>                          EAZY
</b>                It's cool, Jerry. They're my bills,
                my checks. I mean look, my name's
                right there.

      Eazy grins at Jerry, points to his name on the checks.

<b>                          JERRY
</b>                I just wish we could do it here. I
                don't want anything to get
                misplaced or lost --

</b>                Don't worry so much, Jerry. I can

      Eazy picks up the pile of papers and heads for the door.
      Jerry stares after him, visibly shaken --

                Eazy-E had been admitted to Cedars
                Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles and

                month ago but hadn't shown signs of
                improvement, so he checked into the
                hospital. They ran extensive tests
                and as a result we found out
                that... he has what he has...

      About a dozen or so. They stand there quietly, shuffling
      around, staring up at the Hospital --

      Tomica sits in a chair pulled right beside Eazy's bed. They
      hold hands, look at each other. They've both been crying.

      Eazy nods reassuringly, but you can see in his eyes he
      doesn't believe it. Eazy's PHONE rings. He answers it.

</b>
      Tomica and Yella stand by Eazy's bedside. Eazy looks drained,
      depressed. Various members of Eazy's FAMILY are also present.
      Yella holds a CASSETTE in his hand.

      Tomica sits holding Eazy's hand, staring at him with haunted
      eyes. RON SWEENEY stands in the background, along with Eazy's
      Family. Someone else is there now, too. A PASTOR.

          this right. Ron says it's the only
          way to protect everything I built.

Tomica looks to Ron, who nods. She stares off into space,
slowly shaking her head. Her life has become a nightmare.

After looking deep into Eazy's eyes -- He needs her.

</b>          Okay. I love you, Eric.

Ron steps forward, followed by the FAMILY, who gather around
Eazy's bed. Finally, the PASTOR, who smiles kindly at them.

<b>                    PASTOR
</b>          Are we ready?

Tomica and Eazy nod their heads yes. The Pastor reaches out,
holds Tomica's hand in one hand, Eazy's hand in the other.

          husband, to have and to hold...

Tomica tries not to cry, but it's impossible. The tears flow,
and all she can do is wipe them away. Eazy won't stop looking
at Tomica. Like she's the last thing he'll ever see.

      DRE quietly enters the room, nobody in there except him and
      Eazy. He walks to the bed. Looks down at his friend, whom he
      hasn't seen in four years: Eazy's eyes are closed, a
      RESPIRATOR doing his breathing for him.

      NOTE: The BONE TAPE is still sitting, untouched, on the
      bedside table. Eazy never got a chance to listen to it.

      Dre stands there, staring down, in this extended, surreal
      moment. He bends down, so his mouth is close to Eazy's ear.

<b>                          DRE

      We PULL BACK, so WE CAN'T HEAR WHAT DRE IS SAYING. And we
      won't hear it, because that's between Dre &amp; Eazy.

      After a few moments, Dre stands up straight. Whatever he had
      to say to Eazy, he's finished now. He walks to the door --

      On his way out, he passes TOMICA as she's coming in. He looks
      at her. Then he looks at the ring on her finger. Walks away,
      without saying a word...

                sleeping. But he's in a coma. Got a
                machine breathing for him --

      Cube frowns, looks at the ground, pained.

      together, they pass the Police Guards, in tight formation by
      the door, protecting the Hospital. Protecting Eazy.

      To find Suge, looking confused, sitting at the end of the
      long conference table. He's wearing another absurd Red-Devil
