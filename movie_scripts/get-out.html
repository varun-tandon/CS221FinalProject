          I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to
          present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable
          to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed
          to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,
          that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what
          is good and acceptable and perfect. -Romans 12:1-2

          The woods give way to an huge front lawn. A large mansion sits
          in the middle. Thick forest surrounds the estate except for
          one side which is the edge of a lake. The property feels
          expensive and isolated; no other houses in sight.
                         
          As they drive through the large front lawn, Chris sees WALTER,
          African American 35 in the distance facing away. Walter wears
          a gardening hat and trims hedges. He works slowly and
          methodically.

          rushes through the room. The CLOSET DOOR CREEKS open.
                         
          Chris' eyes drift to the pack of cigarettes sticking out of
          his camera bag pocket draped on the desk chair.

          Chris leaves Rose's room and walks down the dark hallway. A
          floorboard creaks under his feet. He turns down the stairs.

          Chris gets to the bottom of the stairs. He hears the
          floorboard creek upstairs. He stops and turns, expecting
          someone to follow him down. Nothing. Chris continues to walk
          down the hallway past the pictures towards the kitchen.
                         
          The basement door is open a crack. Chris peers into it
          curiously. A stairwell leads down into pitch darkness. Chris
          shuts the door. A figure now stands at the end of the hallway
          behind him. He doesn't notice. He just keeps going into...

          looks into the vast night around him. The CRICKETS are
          deafening.
                         
          Suddenly, something DARTS FAST across the yard in the
          distance. Chris peers out into the darkness. The thing RUNS
          across the lawn again. A moment of terror comes over Chris. He
          makes out a shape. It's now running towards him. Chris backs
          up in fear just as the figure emerges from the shadows and
          into the moonlight. It's Walter, the grounds keeper. He passes
          Chris without noticing. Chris gathers his breath.
                         
          The kitchen light turns on and floods the backyard. Chris
          drops the cigarette and stomps it out. He turns back towards
          the house and finds himself face to face with Georgina, who
          glares through the window dead in Chris' eyes. He's caught.
                         
          Georgina doesn't react. Chris it still. Georgina suddenly
          exposes her teeth in a frightening grimace. Chris backs away
          slowly.

          all. She's looking at her teeth in the reflection in the

          notices the bar chair has been moved. She moves it back into
          its original position, and begins cleaning the kitchen
          cabinets. Chris quietly sneaks around the house.

          The auction is flying now. Dean's hand signals are going fast.
          It's down to three couples.
                         
          Dean signals "5, 6." Mr. Greene raises his hand. Dean points.
                         
          Dean signals "5, 8." Mrs. Deets raises her hand. Dean points.
                         
          Dean signals "6." Jim Hudson raises both his hands and signals
          "10." His chauffeur stands beside him whispering in his ear.
          Dean points at him.
                         
          Dean scans the crowd signalling "10, 2?" "10, 2?" The crowd
          looks around. No one is challenging. Dean smiles. Finally Dean
          bangs his fist onto his open palm and points to Jim Hudson.
          Jim's chauffeur whispers in his ear.
                         
          The guests clap in a mixture of delight and disappointment.

          remains parked in the designated parking area. It's the first

          sees a framed picture of Rose inside. Not quite knowing what
          he's looking for, he goes to the closet. The picture is a
          frightening one. Rose is one of the witches in a high school
          production of Macbeth. It's on top of a red shoebox that has
          the drama/comedy masks drawn on top of it.
                         
          He takes it off of the shelf. Inside is a pile of pictures. On
          top is one of Rose dressed as Juliet in a high school play.

          a selfie of her and some other black guy. The picture is
          almost identical to the one she took with Chris before the
          ride up. Under the image are written the words. "X-mas 2014"
          Stunned, Chris flips to the next picture. It's another
          romantic selfie, this time with a different black guy.
          Underneath, the caption "Memorial Day 2013"
                         
          He continues flipping through the stack of pictures of Rose
          with 8 different black guys. The last one is a picture of Rose
          with Walter. In it she kisses Walter's cheek intimately.
          "Thanksgiving 2009" Walter looks different in the picture. He
          isn't smiling vaguely; he's got swagger.

          Jim holds up a Color coded diagram of the human Brain. There
          is a big red part that takes up 80% of the image. The other
          20% is blue and located near the lower back of his skull.

</b>                   Okay so... You see the blue part?
                   That's the piece of your brain
                   that's all rooted in the nervous
                   system. So that stays; keeping
                   those tricky little connections
                   intact. The rest is discarded.
                   Then they'll remove the red part
                   of my brain from my skull and put
                   in yours. Your "blue" and my "red"
                   basically absorb each other. And
                   apparently the brain heals
                   surprisingly fast, so assuming
                   everything goes as planned, we

          Walter/Grandpa spins and gathers his bearing. His eye is
          cocked and blood trickles out of his nose. He let's out a
          PAINED MOAN reminiscent of the deer's.

          Walter/Grandpa shoots Jeremy in the chest. He falls. Chris, on
          his back, pushes himself away. Walter/Grandpa sees Chris'
          scurry. He turns looking mad.

          Walter/Grandpa raises the gun under his own chin and shoots
          himself through the head. He falls. Approaching sirens blare
          in the distance.
                         
          Chris lays in shock. It's over. Just then a hand grabs Chris
          face! Jeremy's still alive! Blood pours from his mouth.

          They both go for the gun, grabbing it at the same time. They
          roll around in the grass. Chris ends up on top. He bludgeons
          Jeremy over and over with the butt of the gun into the ground.
          Chris is lost in violence.
                         
          2 police cars pull up. He drops the gun.
