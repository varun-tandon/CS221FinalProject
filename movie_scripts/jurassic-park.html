EXTREME CLOSEUP of glowing honey-colored stones.  Their shapes ABSTRACT
as THE CAMERA EXAMINES air bubbles and crystalline patterns.

MOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual
shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt,
hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the
different surfaces of the stones.

CAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,
abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly
RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is
folded on its back.

<b>SLOW MOTION
</b> as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber
toward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The
drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.

A SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and
extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit
glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.
arriving under a long-lensed microscope.

IN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately
removes a fragment of tissue.

PINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube
SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen.

THE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a
neutral mist.

<b>                                                     WASH OUT TO:
</b>
HOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY -


<b>EXT  BADLANDS - AFTERNOON
</b>
Lodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains
of A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI
<b>NG
</b>PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers
shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs,
scribbling notes, and conferring with each other.

The center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that
circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head
paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard.

Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone.
A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence.

CLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it.

Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker
way to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his
feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Right calcaneus of an adult female
          raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's
          this tell me?

Students look at each other.  A tentative hand.  Grant continues.

<b>               
</b><b>             GRANT
</b>          It tells me that this bone connects to
          the navicula which we already found
          articulating to the cuboid.

OFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him.

                            ELLIE (off)
          Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!

Grant looks up.

DR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs
like a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of
dust behind her.

She zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her.

<b>                            STUDENT
</b>          Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking!

Dr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress
          fractures in the heel ...

Uncertain students.  Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          She jumps.

Grant turns around to her and smiles.  She's got it.  Other students to
- they knew is all along.

<b>            
</b><b>                GRANT
</b>          Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she
          jump?

No answer.  Ellie gives it a try.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          A defensive posture against a vicious,
          blood-thirsty T-Rex?

<b>                            GRANT
</b>              (nodding)
          Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,
          more tender leaves in the higher branches
          with which to suckle her young?

Ellie jumps up.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          I bet is was a mating ritual.

Students laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          The science of paleontology can't answer
          these questions.  Novelists and artists
          who dream a vision of the Jurassic period
          can attempt these questions with their
          imaginations.  What we scientists can say
          is considering the mass and kinetic
          articulation of these bones, this animal
          had a vertical leap
 of about twelve feet.
          Not as entertaining as fiction, but
          absolutely fact without prejudice.

Ellie intrudes again.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is,
          we're late.  There's the car.

She points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a
dusty wake.

Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually
as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Jim, you keep making up the plaster
          batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,
          it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after
          five - when the temperature drops, those
          bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I
          don't want any tourists walking over my
          raptor - I don't care if the Governor of
          Montana is with them, just you guys.

Grant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          You know, if ev
ery scientist stuck to his
          method like you, there would be no body
          of theory - no quasars, no big bang -

Grant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering
          Hammond's world, that's for sure.  (beat)
          Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.

Ellie is gentle.  She's telling him something they've discussed before.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          We're leaving the raptor dig -

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          - at a critical time -

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          - because Gennaro is paying us sixty
          thousand dollars to observe some resort
          of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          - enough money to keep us free of
          commercial affiliations for two summers.
          All right, all right.  Good.

Then, half-kidding with Ellie:

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Financial
 independence for fraternizing
          with the enemy?  (beat)  I'll do it.

She laughs.  But he can't quite leave.  He grabs a computer printout

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          This is all could come up with, Skip?

Skip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand.  Grant smiles.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie.

Grant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students.
The limo pulls away.


<b>EXT  HIGH TECH BUILDING - BIOGENETIC CORPORATION HQ - SUNSET
</b>
A purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building.


<b>INT  BIOGEN HQ
</b>
A peanut flies in the air.  Then falls into a big open mouth.  THOMP.

<b>                            MOUTH
</b>          Five hundred thousand is peanuts!

He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth.  This is DENNIS
NEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer.  He's fat, with greasy hair
and a permanently wrinkled suit.  His slovenly looks are wildly out of
place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin
es.

Across a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A
smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy
appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.

Nedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          I'm not reneging.  I'm re-evaluating.

Nedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          You think I'm a scumbag, I know.

Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table.  One after the
other, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one. It
skids across the glossy floor.

Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic
          industrial espionage, and you're bound to
          run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!
          Part of the job description.  Look, who's
          to say, who is the real scumbag?  After
          all, I know what you guys need so bad.
          I've heard of reverse engineering.

As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Let the other guy put in all the work,
          all the R and D.  You take the finished
          product, work backwards, breaking it down
          to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In
          a few measly months you have know-how
          that took researchers ten years to
          determine.  You know how much Hammond has
          invested of his own personal wealth?
          Over five billion dollars!  And if you
          guys get the jump on his - in no time,
          the market's wide-open.

Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          But, boy, he's really got his product!
          Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-
          making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that
          product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!

Nedry LAUGH
S explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.

Baker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.

Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs
toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and
squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his
hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone
and desperate Nedry.

<b>                            BAKER
</b>          Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is
          not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-
          evaluation.

Bakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.

<b>                            BAKER
</b>          The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.

Baker glances at his watch.

<b>                            BAKER
</b>          I'll give you a few minutes to decide.

Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head.  Baker nods back
and SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.

Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up
, rubbing his belly.  As
Baker leaves the room:

<b>                            BAKER
</b>          Make sure the eggs are on that supply
          ship.  Just make sure!

CAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window.    IT SWISHPANS the concrete
canyons of Wall Street and enters another office.


<b>INT  CONSERVATIVE LAW OFFICE - DAY
</b>
DONALD GENNARO, handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly
polished, glassy corner suite.  His boss, ROSS, is seated.  He's a
powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.

<b>                            ROSS
</b>          We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's
          under too much pressure.  There's the
          EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-
          vestors are getting nervous.  There have
          been too many rumors, too many accidents.
          We can't screw around with this.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          I've asked Hammond to arrange independent
          site inspections every week for the next
          three weeks.

<b>                            ROS
</b><b>S
</b>          What does he say?

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          Insists nothing's wrong on the island.

<b>                            ROSS
</b>          You know him.  Do you believe him?

<b>                             GENNARO
</b>          No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with
          him five years ago when we raised the
          capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's
          unpredictable, a dreamer.

<b>                            ROSS
</b>          Potentially dangerous.  We should never
          have gotten involved.  What's our position?

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          The firm owns five percent.

<b>                            ROSS
</b>          General or limited?

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          General.

<b>                            ROSS
</b>          We should have never done that.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          It seemed wise at the time.  We all
          wanted the park to happen.  It was in
          lieu of fees.

<b>                            ROSS
</b><b>        
</b>  In any case, I agree an inspection is
          overdue.  Who are your site experts?

Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out.

<b>                            ROSS
</b>          Will they tell the truth?

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot
          in his field, always goes his own way -

<b>                            ROSS
</b>          - Good.  You're making all the arrangements?

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          Hammond asked to place the calls himself.
          I think he wants to pretend the park is
          not in trouble.  That it's just a social
          invitation, showing off the island.

<b>                            ROSS
</b>          All right ... Good.  But let's be very
          clear about one thing.  I don't know how
          bad this situation actually is, Donald.
          But if there's a problem on that island -
          don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn
          Jurassic Park to the ground.

Gennaro shakes hands 
awkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed-
up, he whispers to himself.

<b>                            ROSS
</b>          Costa Rica, my ass.

He whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning.

CAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a
helicopter and DISSOLVE TO:


<b>INT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN
</b>
On the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar.

INSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie
dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his
discomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the
clear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a
candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row.

Grant loses himself, looking out the window.

GRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there
are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air.
Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds.

There is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the
window.  
There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping
a dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the
island below them eerily fits right into her doodling.

<b>                            PILOT
</b>          That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the
          descent is a little hairy.

Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes
out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          This is exciting!

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?

Grant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the
water.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Looks like Alcatraz.

The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.

<b>                            PILOT
</b>          There's bad wind shear on this peak.

Grant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt.

Ellie
 smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET
FOG.  Grant can't see a thing out his window.  Ellie's startled.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          How the hell is he landing this thing?

No answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through
the mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          This is not fun.

Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant
glowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't
          land if it weren't safe.

The copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.
Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,
          Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!

Another violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.

CLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a 
packet of crackers.

Gennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.
He speaks a mantra.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          No problem.  Relax, relax.

The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails
sharply the other way.

<b>                            GRANT AND ELLIE
</b>          Whoa!!!!

CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.

THE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours
across the floor.

Nedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang
suspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.

Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          I don't like this feeling ...

The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.
Trees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.
Ellie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.

IN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose
low, fo
r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal
bucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches
down on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.

For a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.
Gennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.

Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.
Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Just think, Gennaro -
              (laughs harder)
          - you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,
          they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,
          isn't it?

Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.

Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door.

A smile comes across Gennaro's face.  As he smiles he motions with his
hands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him.

<b>      
</b><b>                      PILOT
</b>          Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a
          storm alert.

ROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball
cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He
shakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.
He throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla
          Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little
          tough landing here, I know.  But you did
          it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have
          you.  Now, watch your step.

Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.


<b>EXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING
</b>
Grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the
opposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:
huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;
rushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds
a
nd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant
and Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.

Then, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon
directs A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back
the abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon
over.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.

<b>                            ED REGIS
</b>          This is Robert Muldoon, great African big
          game hunter.  And he's working for us now.
          Doing a bang-up job, too.

Muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.
          Gennaro, nice to have you back.

Gennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work.

Regis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old
friend.  Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone.  At the rear, Grant and
Ellie study everything they see.  Grant
 calls to Regis but is ignored.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?

Ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path
they just walked on.  She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Aggressive growth, huh?

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Hammond's trademark.

A distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and
Ellie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Out animals are greeting you!

They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.
Grant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          I hope this isn't one of those animatronic
          exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Nope.

Gennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm
that leads to the 
VISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.

Ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.

THEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.
The needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.

This fence is only the prelude.

Sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.
Woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical
wire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN
<b>THOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!
</b>
CAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the
highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.

Grant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.

They reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade
trees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off
the walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper
truck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.

<b>                       
</b><b>     REGIS
</b>          I hope you brought your bathing suits!
          Doesn't this mist and these plants really
          create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?

Regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          There's the Visitor's Center.

A CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS.


<b>INT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY
</b>
CLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight.
Above, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.

Grant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,
Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.

The Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed
girders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where
the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,
exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL
SPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.

<b>                            GRANT
</b><b>     
</b>     Where's Hammond?

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.

Grant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the
          air conditioning sucks.

Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the
finished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.

Grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the
World.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours
in a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the
dinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          The audicity of man to get here at the
          last second and think he runs the show.

Grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted
mural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop.

Nedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change
.  It doesn't work.  He
SLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.
Upside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.

THE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a
catwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are
locked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies
are scattered all around.

Regis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles.

At that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically.
A soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.

<b>                            VOICE (ON P.A.)
</b>          Please come to the theater.  In a moment,
          our film will begin.

The voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages.
Regis waves everyone into the theater.   Nedry doesn't join them.  He
climbs the stairs to the second floor.


<b>INT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Small and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and
Ellie sit further behind. 
 Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.

CELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage
floor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion.

years young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own
effect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast
pocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome
          to an ancient and mysterious world, a
          world long before humankind inhabited it
          with all out remarkable dreams and
          questions.  Enter a world that existed
          one hundred million years ago.  When our
          changing earth was the abode of
          magnificent creations.

          Today, the late twentieth century has
          witnessed a scientific gold rush of
          astonishing proportions:  the headlong
          and furious haste to un
ravel the mystery
          of genetic engineering has become more
          than just a subject for science fiction
          writers.

ON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          - the furious haste to commercialize
          genetic engineering.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Biotechnology promises the greatest
          revolution in human history.  It will
          outdistance atomic power and computers in
          its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll
          see square trees for easy lumbering and
          white trout for super visibility to
          fisherman.  Why it will transform every
          aspect of human life: out medical care,
          our food, our health, even our very
          entertainment.

ON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Here we go.

BACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b><b>          
</b>Nothing will ever be the same again.
          It's literally going to change the face
          of our planet as we know it.


MUSIC SOARS.  Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose.  A screen
descends behind him.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          ... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is
          made possible through the miracle of DNA
          replication, commonly known as cloning.
          To explain what cloning means, I'm going
          to need my own clone - John Hammond.

Another Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.

<b>                            2ND HAMMOND
</b>          Hi, John!

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Hi, John.

IN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud.  Grant, shaking his head, smiles.

BACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Okay John, hold out your finger.

<b>                            2ND HAMMOND
</b>          Why?

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          I need some of your
 genetic material.

<b>                            2ND HAMMOND
</b>          Now just a minute here, John.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Your genetic material is the same in
          every cell of your body.  You have a
          hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a
          couple.

Hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with
a thorn.

<b>                            2ND HAMMOND
</b>          OW!!!  That hurt!  Hey, what's -

The clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as WE SEE a magnified view
of the bloodstream.  ANIMATION begins which illuminates the parts of the
blood and its actions.  Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          John, let's look into your blood, the
          river of life.  There's your white cells,
          exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily
          wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,
          the heart and brain of a cell.  This
          nucleus has an amazing property.  It can
          sp
lit in half and reproduce itself.
          That's how it grows.  And then those two
          can do it again.  And again.  Making copy
          after copy of itself.

Back to the two Hammond's.  Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on
until the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room.

<b>                            NEW HAMMOND'S
</b>          Hi, I'm John Hammond.  Hey, I'm John
          Hammond.  No, I am.  I am.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Come on, that's enough of this!  And I
          thought to reproduce myself I had to do it
          the old-fashioned way.

New mist fades out this show.  The lights go up.  Regis applauds.  Grant
joins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro.

Hammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          That's all we've got so far.  A lot of
          fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          You bet!

Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly.  Then 
Hammond baits Grant.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the
          preceding was not your sort of enter-
          tainment.  Popular science -

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike
          the commercialization of science.  It breeds
          a sloppiness, a disregard for method.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Well, I don't disregard method.  But think
          of mutation - which is nothing more than
          sloppy communication on the cellular
          level.  Think how triumphant mutations
          have been in natural selection.

          Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's
          true that I have never been afraid to make
          money with science.  I've always
          considered profit to be a measure of
          success, a barometer of public reaction.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a
          scientific law ha
s nothing to do with
          public reaction.  Water freezes at
          thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for
          it or not.

Hammond turns to Gennaro.  Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan
          Grant, you've brought an excellent critic
          to observe the viability of my island and
          out venture.  I look forward to winning
          you over, Dr. Grant.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Just what is it you're trying to clone?


<b>EXT  A SPRAWLING LAWN - DAY
</b>
Outside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie.  He points out the
staff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees.  Next to their
homes, WORKERS hang laundry and cook on grills.

They pass a large Mechanical Building.  The generator housed within is
very LOUD.  The wind increases, rippling clothes.

Suddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep.  Grant turns.

Racing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP.  Muldoon is 
at
the steering wheel.  Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep.
They are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister.  The jeep stops.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Grandpa!

Hammond looks up, delighted.  Arms open.  Gennaro pulls him close.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>              (incredulous)
          Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga-
          tion of the island, not a weekend
          excursion or a social outing.  We're
          talking about the safety of this place!

Hammond waves to the children.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          I'm aware of that.  But I built this
          place for children.  You can't
          investigate it without their reactions.
          They're what this place is all about.

Hammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind.
          They're more like my ex-wife than me.

Lex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms.  Timmy s
hyly walks up and
embraces him.  Hammond shines.  Gennaro holds in his fury.


<b>INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY
</b>
Hammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite.
Ellie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrasting
lifestyle below.  She then focuses on the high fence, circling the
perimeter of Hammond's quarters.  Above is a skylight, with metal bars.

Grant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Who makes a windows ... smaller?

Timmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          I know you.  You wrote my book.  Lost
          World of The Dinosaurs.  It's awesome.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Don't worry - he'll grow out of it.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was
          so widely successful.  He wrote if for
          gra
duate students.

Hammond smiles intensely.  But he's patient.  He stands be a huge table
covered with a sumptuous velvet drape.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise,
          this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked,
          poorly funded plan that I've headed.
          This is a plan to which I committed all
          of my personal resources, literally
          billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro
          here has kindly helped me raise that sum
          again from wealthy Japanese.  They love
          theme parks.  I have recruited pre-
          eminent scientific minds from hallowed
          universities and we've taken the time to
          do things right.

Lex peeks under the cloth.  Hammond smiles at her and recovers the table.

<b>                            HAMMOND

          with genetics - life's essential building
          blocks - to create new 
worlds.  I set out
          to make biological attractions.  Living
          attractions.  Attractions so astonishing
          that they'd capture the imagination of
          the entire world.

<b>                            GRANT

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          As you well know, long ago, creatures ten
          times larger than whales roamed our
          adolescent Earth.  And then mass,

          barrier unscalable until ... now.

</b>          Dinosaurs.
              (superbly proud)
          I've been cloning dinosaurs!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant's incredulous face.

Hammond whips off the drape, revealing a complex and detailed scale
model of the entire resort.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park.  Not
          a resort, not a scien
tific conservatory,
          just a little piece of pre-history that

          insist on visiting.

Hammond grins with delight.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          At least every rich child.

Grant and Ellie come forward to examine the model.  The kids crowd in.

CAMERA SNORKELS through the model - revealing different enclosures with
miniature dinosaurs, moats, fences, roads, a river.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Apatosaurs in the lowland.  Gallimimus in

          to just kill each other?

Hammond excitedly punches a button - colored display grids light up.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Timmy, there's electric fences and moats
          and video surveillance at all times.
          There
 are monitors every hundred feet
          whatever we could plant them on the
          island.  A computer to tabulate it all.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          You created dinosaurs?  Who gave you the
          right to do that?

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          I didn't create them.  I found a way to
          wake them up, to stir them out of their
          prehistoric slumber.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          We don't have the science.  There's no
          source of dinosaur DNA.

Hammond's proud, excited face shifts to one that divulges modestly.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Yes ... there is.


<b>INT  HALLWAY, UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY
</b>
Hammond leads Grant, Ellie, Gennaro, Timmy, and Lex out of an elevator
and down an endless corridor.  A WORKMAN ON CRUTCHES passes them.

They go through a series of security doors.  To get them open, Hammond
places his palm on a screen before each door.  Each time, it lights up
with an x-ray-like image of 
his hand and each door HISSES open.

CLOSEUP - Security x-ray. of Hammond's hand.  BEEP.  A red line writes
through the screen.  Can't get in.  Complaining, under his breath:

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Glitches.

Hammond tries again.


<b>INT  CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</b>
The door HISSES open, revealing an elaborate technology-crammed room.
In dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow.

Nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him,
typing away.  JOHN ARNOLD, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the
activities of the park and chain-smoking.  There are large windows
looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from
the outside by a TEAM OF WORKMEN.

Hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage.  He's the
ringmaster.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          And this is the right side of my brain.
          The entire park is safely controlled from
          here.  John Arnold, that genius over
          there, is the m
aster control operator.
              (with genuine concern)
          John, don't smoke so much, you're far too
          valuable a man to me.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Oh, you'd survive just fine without me.

Arnold exhales smoke and waves good-naturedly.  Nedry stares darkly at
Hammond, who ignores him.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Everything's controlled from here.
          Remote everything. Cars, feeding
          programs, medicine dispensers, fecal
          clean up - and that can be tons in a park
          like this.  We run this place with twenty
          workers.  This computer does it all.  And
          it polices each and every single animal
          out there.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>              (whispers to Grant)
          Who polices the computer?

Hammond points up.  Overlooking the control room and the park is a
raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court.  A large
video screen faces this chair.

<b>                     
</b><b>       HAMMOND
</b>          That's where I will watch the astonished
          watchers.  Okay, let's go.

They practically race as a group to keep up with Hammond.  The security
door seals shit, leaving Nedry and Arnold alone again.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical
          contributions have made it all possible.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Right.


<b>BACK ON HALLWAY -
</b>
Hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked:
CAUTION: Teratogenic Substances.  Timmy backs off, grabs Lex's arm.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          That stuff turns you into a mutant!

He contorts his face into strange shapes.  As Hammond leads them all in
Lex pulls on his pocket.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Don't mind the signs.  They're only legal
          precautions.

Gennaro frowns.  The door opens and Lex peeks in.

<b>                  
</b><b>          HAMMOND
</b>          My laboratory, Lex.  It will be yours and
          Timmy's someday.


<b>INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY - CONTINUING ACTION
</b>
Grant and Ellie share a baffled look.  Grant stares.

Grant's POV - PAN ACROSS a room filled with honey-colored glowing stones
arranged on glass shelves in large pull-out trays.  Each stone is tagged
and numbered.

Grant leans down, studying the stones.  He bumps right into Gennaro.
Lex jumps excitedly.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          It's ... gold!

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          It's amber.  Fossilized tree sap.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Grandpa found gold.

Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          You're both right.  Amber is our gold.
          The alpha or our alchemic alphabet.  The
          precious course of our genetic material.
          You already know amber is the fossilized
          resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course.

Grant and Ellie nod impatiently. 
 Hammond sets the scene.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap
          flowing over insects, as it does now as I
          speak, in thousands of forests and backyard
          trees everywhere.  Imagine that ancient sap
          trapping a little struggling insect and
          consuming it in a syrupy death.  Millions
          and millions of years pass and we come
          along and discover this prehistoric insect.
          If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in
          a fossil form inside the hardened sap which
          is now amber.  And as we examine more and
          more amber, we find many perished insects,
          including among them, biting insects -

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Like mosquitos -

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Mosquitos that sucked the blood of
          dinosaurs.  That's your source of DNA
<b>        
</b>  material?  My God!  It just might work.


<b>INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY
</b>
A TECHNICIAN carefully positions a piece of amber under a fine-pointed
drill.  With a nod, the technician's goggles drop from his forehead onto
his eyes and he starts up the drill.  Hammond yells over the loud WHIRR.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          The extraction room speaks for itself.

CLOSE ON - drillbit boring into the amber.  Orange fleck fly.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          It does?

The technician shuts the drill.  Placing his hands into a mounted pair
of gloves, he operates an automated pair of needle-nose pliers to
carefully lift out the remains of a mosquito.  He drops this bug on a
slide and places this slide on a tray full of such slides.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          That's a million year old mosquito?

A conveyor belt starts, carrying this tray on to the NEXT TECHNICIAN.
The group follows.  This technician puts the first slide under a
microscope.  Grant watches on a video monito
r as the tech inserts a long
needle into the prehistoric bug.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito,
          drill it out.  Right?

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Right.  You are witnessing the extraction
          of tissue from the thorax of this humble
          insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any
          foreign red blood cells - say it bit a
          hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we
          will extract those blood cells and obtain
          paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction
          book of an extinct creature.
          So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino-
          saurs. Fossils left behind the information,
          the map of how to bring them back.  I'm
          helping them escape from the confined of
          time.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't
          give you enough tissue to determine a
          complete DNA strand.

<b>                 
</b><b>           HAMMOND
</b>          Right you are, Dr. Grant!  More like
          hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are
          necessary to provide even a partial
          strand of DNA.  And without a complete
          strand, we don't have a dinosaur.


<b>INT  GENETICS ROOM
</b>
A LOUD HUMMING SOUND.  Along the walls are rows of waist-high stainless
steel boxes.  In the room's center are two six-foot-high round towers.
At a single console, a man studies a monitor.

DR. WU, 35, looks up from his study and beams at his guests.  He jumps
up and knocks over his cup of coffee.  ASSISTANTS clean the area as Wu
comes forward and actually hugs Grant, much to Grant's embarrassment.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Ah, I knew you two would hit it off!  Dr.
          Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist.

<b>                            WU
</b>          Finally, you are here!  I've been working
          without the encouragement of my peers for
          too long.  Welcome, welcome!

He kisses Ellie, who takes 
it in stride.  Gennaro, We already knows.

<b>                            WU
</b>          Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and
          he's interested only in results, not in
          science.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Don't forget to thank me when you pick up
          your Nobel prize.

Hammond and Wu resume the tour.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          You are standing in the middle of the
          most powerful genetics factory created
          since the expulsion from Eden.

<b>                            WU
</b>          These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene
          sequencers, those are Cray XMP's,
          supercomputers that take DNA information
          and organize it.  In this room, we take
          fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and
          compare them to other incomplete strands.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          It's like finding the missing pieces of a
          jigsaw puzzle.

<b>                            WU
</b>          The computers make sever
al trillion
          calculations to provide us with a
          complete DNA strand - the genetic code of
          an extinct animal.


<b>INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY
</b>
A vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables.  The
first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of
test tubes.  Wu leads the group.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Okay, you have your "complete" DNA
          strand.  How do you grow it?

<b>                            WU
</b>          We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our
          breeding medium.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Our primordial soup.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          And how do you know what it is you're
          growing?

Wu shrugs.

<b>                            WU
</b>          Well, we have computer techniques to try
          and map out finds on an evolutionary
          basis.  But mostly, we just grow it and
          find out what it is.  If it's something
          we're interested in, and it 
survives, we
          keep it.

Grant and Ellie share a concerned look.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          And if you're not interested?

Wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull-and-crossbone warnings.
Timmy regards the poison with excitement.

Lex calls from deeper in the room.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Come look!

Here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured
by a grey mist that covers the tables.  The eggs are all gently rocking
as TECHNICIANS roam up and down the aisles.

Hammond walks ahead of the group.  As Wu speaks, Hammond listens and
enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time.

<b>                            WU
</b>          This is the incubation room.  We keep the
          temperature at ninetynine degrees and a
          relative humidity of one hundred percent.

<b>                            GRANT AND TIMMY
</b>          Jurassic atmosphere.

Timmy smiles at Grant.  Hammond winks at Timmy.

<b>                            WU
</b>          We
 also run a high oxygen concentration,
          up to thirty-three percent, so if you
          feel faint, please tell me right away.

Lex feigns a faint, Timmy cracks a small smile. They move forward,
waist-deep in the mist.  A strange green light emanates from the
incubators.  Lex is half-consumed by the mist. She mimics the witch.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          I'm ... melting!

Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close.

<b>                            WU
</b>          Reptile eggs contain large amounts of
          yolk but no water at all.  The embryos
          must extract water from the surrounding
          environment.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          That's why you create the mist.

Wu nods.  Hammond just enjoys the scene as Grant and Ellie watch a
thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a
flexible wand, beeping.  Lex and Timmy let their hands glide over the
sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big
eggs they hold.

<b>                   
</b><b>         WU
</b>          Children, please do not touch!  The eggs
          are permeable to skin oils.

Grant that very close to an egg.  He sniffs it.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          What kind of eggs are these?  Are these
          shells plastic?

<b>                            WU
</b>          Yes, they are,  The embryos are
          mechanically inserted and then hatched in
          this room.  But we've managed to
          sufficiently mimic the actual biological
          process - these creatures rupture the
          plastic membrane that they're contained
          in when they're born.  Like real births.

They reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall,
beneath a viewing area like those found in an OB-GYN ward.

<b>                            WU
</b>          Eggs that are determined viable spend
          their last couple days in our specially-
          designed incubators, which help
          accelerate the pre-natal developmental
          stages.  Which is interesting becaus
e
          we're having a problem with the adult
          animals -

Hammond claps a hand over Wu's mouth and laughs.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle.
          Now who wants to see the real thing?

As they exit the CAMERA PANS the misty aisles, studying the eggs.


<b>EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY
</b>
Blue shadows of clouds sweep across an expansive green hill in front of
the Visitor's Center.

Grant and Hammond make their way down below to the loading area for the
park tour.  A little ahead is Gennaro and Ellie.  Gennaro chatters on
while Ellie energetically explores the area, looking at the plants.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          ... so naturally, Hammond's going to
          present everything in the best light.  I
          need to know that this park is safe.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          I'll tell you something that troubles me
          from the start.  The carnivores are all
          well-fed and kept separated from their

          natural prey.  That'll keep 'em alive,
          but it won't keep 'em happy.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          How do you mean?

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          The carnivores will want to hunt.  It's
          an instinct.  And that instinct will have
          to be satisfied or suppressed.

FURTHER UP THE HILL, moving slowly, Hammond eyes the pair suspiciously.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Gennaro is putting negative ideas into
          Ellie's head.  He's a naysayer.  I have
          no affection for that type of thinking.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own
          judgments.

At the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball.


<b>EXT  TOUR START - DAY
</b>
The group gathers.  TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them.
Regis leans out of the first one.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Hey!  Great day for a tour!

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          Looks like rain to me.

<b>         
</b><b>                   REGIS
</b>          No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off
          till we got back.

The kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars.  Timmy
finds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top.

Grant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now.

The cars begin to move and pass Hammond.  He waves.

Gennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush.  Hammond waves.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Gennaro, for once in your life, let
          something really move you.

In the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck.  He turns to Grant.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's
          damn guinea pigs?

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          I like to wait and see.

Ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate.
Regis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro.

The gate's doo
rs swing open and the cruisers move forward.  The kids
squeal out a YA-HOO that floats through the air to Grant.  But Grant
wears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape.

A FANFARE of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from a
console in each cruiser.  Video screens display a welcome message.

<b>                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE

          earth, which you are privileged to see
          for the first time ...

Regis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser.

<b>                            REGIS (ON WALKIE)

<b>INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FIRST TOUR STOP - DAY
</b>
Between massive tree trunks, a spectacular view:  stor
m clouds touch
mountaintops.  Below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents.

<b>                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
</b>          ... and the grasses are a species of
          juniper, and samples can be purchased at
          the gift shop.  Now, if everyone will
          take a look to the right ...

All eyes swing that way.  Grant doesn't see a thing.  Nor do the others.

AHEAD, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies
the location.  Lex grabs the night goggles.  Timmy pulls them from her.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Look ...

<b>                            LEX AND TIMMY
</b>          I don't see anything.  Do you see
          anything?  There's nothing there.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Something's out there ...

IN THE SECOND CAR, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield.  Grant hangs out
his window almost sniffing the air for some movement.  Nothing.

SUDDENLY the trees in front of them move!  A deep trumpeting SOUND and
TWO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away fr
om the side of the road.  The ground
SHAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air.  Led by Grant, the
passengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up
at the dinosaurs far above.

DROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.  Utter
amazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile
then a laugh.  He simply can't believe his eyes. His laugh becomes
raucous and euphoric.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation
          team seeing this!

Behind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile.  Gennaro
squints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality.

IN THE CAR AHEAD, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed.  Regis looks at the
animal and then at the group's reverie.  He smiles knowingly: he's been
there, too.  He bends and whispers:

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Congratulations. You're the first kids in
          the whole wide world ever to see real
          dinosaurs.

The
 kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes.

GRANT CAN'T stop laughing.  Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to
peer at this laughing man.  The brachiosaur's huge head stops inches
away from Grant.  Grant, awestruck, stares and them -

CLOSE ON - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints.

The dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Alan?  Alan?
              (sort of delighted)
          He fainted!

Gennaro waves to Regis that all is okay.  Grant slowly revives.  He
looks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away.  He looks at
Ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a
look of serene delight.

Gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him.  A
glazed look fills his face.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          My God, we're going to make a fortune
          here!

CAMERA PUSHES IN on the majestic, gentle beauty of the Brachiosaurs.
JUNGLE SOUNDS DOMINATE, growing l
ouder and louder.


<b>INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</b>
Hammond sits at his throne, happily watching the huge video screen which
displays the tour group.  He laughs raucously and calls to Arnold.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          He fainted.  I've waited fifteen years to
          impress that young man.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt
          you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Oh, balls.


<b>INT/EXT  CRUISERS, SECOND TOUR STOP - DAY
</b>
The cruisers come to a stop.  In the distance, A HERD OF GALLIMIMUS
graze.  They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, then
drop gracefully down on all fours to chew.  BABY GALLIMIMUS scamper
around the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals.

<b>                             PRE-RECORDED VOICE
</b>          ... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich
          dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders,
          have a very strong nesting instinct ...

Grant do
esn't listen.  He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty
of the gentle, grazing dinosaurs.  Suddenly, he looks away with a deep
concern.  Ellie looks at him questioningly.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Ellie?  What the hell are we going to do
          with the rest of our lives?

Ellie smiles at him, puzzled.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          What to you mean?

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Can't you see it, Ellie?  We're the ones
          that are extinct now.


<b>INT/EXT  CRUISERS, THIRD TOUR STOP - DAY
</b>
<b>                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
</b>          ... lots more to see in the herbivore
          section of our park.  But as we come
          alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the
          left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a
          very unusual and dangerous carnivore.
          Look across the river and above ...

A lovely mossy clearing.  And to the side, bounded just by a thicket of
bushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus
h and clear.  The
river runs fast but it is narrow.  On the other side is a sharp rise.

<b>                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
</b>          And there they are!

Standing on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop
are TWO DILOPHOSAURUS, man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around
their necks.  Grant and Ellie chime in with the pre-recorded voice.

<b>                            ALL THREE
</b>          Dilophosaurus!

Timmy and Lex point enthusiastically.  Regis holds them down with a
gentle but restraining arm.

<b>                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
</b>          Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest
          carnivores.  Scientists once thought
          their jaw muscles were too weak to kill,
          but now, through the miracle of their
          cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom,
          a poison which causes blindness and then
          unconsciousness.

Their distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          Poisonous d
inosaurs, there's a liability
          issue without a lot of precedent.

CLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus.  One yawns wide.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>              (assessing)
          It's like a Gila monster of a cobra.  It's
          a poison ...

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Spitter!

The Spitters bound off as Grant watches, transfixed.  A flock of birds
burst from a tree and cross the sky.  Trees filter the light.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Are we dreaming all this?


<b>EXT  RAPTOR PIT - DAY
</b>
A big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh.  Suddenly, a
dark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS.  A SCREECH
animals GROWL and SNARL.  An animal slams its face into the mesh.  SPARKS
illuminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH.

Muldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle.
Hammond comes in a hurry.  Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle.
He walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there.

<b>               
</b><b>             MULDOON
</b>          These raptors are too damn dangerous. One
          of them tunneled out this morning.  He
          ripped a boy's arm off before I could get
          a bullet in him.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I
          have five left?

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          John, they're mean as scorpions and smart
          as chimps.  Their little fingers make
          them natural cage-breakers.  We should
          terminate the raptor program.  They're
          just too smart.  Too damn smart.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors
          just because they're behaving normally.
          They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them
          properly?

Hammond starts to walk away.  Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          John, remember back in '88, when we
          started to build the containment devices?
<b>         
</b> We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns
          that blow out electric nets.  They're all
          too slow for these guys. If we're going
          to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles
          and laser-guided devices.

Hammond laughs warmly.  He pats Muldoon on the back.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure
          out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit
          down and have a nice long discussion about
          raptors - after my guests leave, okay?

Hammond walks away.  Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his
hand.  Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round
          the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence.
          And wear your rifle when you're working!


<b>INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
Hammond enters and crosses to his throne.  Hammond swivels to Arnold who
exhales smoke.  Nedry looks over, keeps typing.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Wh
ere are they?  Punch 'em up.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          They'll be by the trike's in a moment.
          Trike's sick again.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          How can you say it so matter-of-factly?
          The trike's.  You casually accept it, but
          I never can.  You know what it means when
          you say "by the trikes"?  "By the
          trike's" means that they're out there by
          the species:  triceratops horridus.  It
          astounds me every time what I've done
          here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We
          turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur.
          I will never be complacent about that.

Arnold smiles and punches a button.  WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voice
and some chatter of the kids.

EAVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to the
control room.  Arnold slides over and shuts off the tour monitoring.
The picture on the video screen is now of a cargo boat at a dock.

<b>                            RADIO
</b><b> 
</b>         Hello, John.  This is the Anne B at the
          dock.  I'm looking at the storm patterns
          just south of us.  Requesting permission
          to leave before unloading the last three
          food containers.

Nedry looks up quickly, listening carefully.

<b>                            RADIO
</b>          Don't want to be stuck here if this chop
          gets much worse.

Hammond reacts with quiet dismay.  Nedry quietly gets up.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Coffee anyone?

He's ignored.  Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you
          tonight?  I certainly don't want to
          imperil anyone.  But can you give us one
          more container of food?  Then we'll feel
          comfortable is the storm delays your
          return.  Could you help us out here?  Of
          course, if it looks too choppy just go,
          but you'd be doing us a big favor.

<b>                 
</b><b>           RADIO
</b>          Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll
          get one more container off. How's that?

Hammond thanks him and signs off.  Arnold looks at the darkening clouds.


<b>INT/EXT  CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
The cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears.  The
first car comes to a jerky stop.

There is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly,
breathing laboriously.  HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on
the ground.  He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight.

Before the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the
trike.  Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie.

Grant joins Harding on the ground.  The trike lets out a low MOAN.
She's too sick to move.  Ellie and Lex squat by the animal.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          I feel so sorry for her.  She's so sick.

<b>                            VET
</b>          We don't know what's wrong with Freda.
          Every six we
eks she gets like this.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Oh, she'll be up and around in no time.
          After a big night, I feel the same way.

Grant very gently opens the Trike's mouth.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Poor girl.  What's the matter?  Ellie,
          look at this.

A dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth.  Ellie shines the
light on it, illuminating silvery blisters.  Gennaro turns away.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Microvesicles.  Interesting.

Grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball-point pen.  It oozes.
The kids share a grossed-out look.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?

<b>                            HARDING
</b>          We make these dinosaurs in the lab,
          sweetheart.  But they do form attachments.
          Freda has a little one that follows her
          around, thinks Freda's his mom.

Grant starts to look around.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          What does sh
e eat?  Where does she feed?

<b>                            HARDING
</b>          Animal this size takes in a minimum of
          six hundred pounds of plants a day.  We
          truck in hay and meadow grasses seven
          times a day.  That's all she touches.

Grant studies the nearby grass and bushes.  Timmy quietly follows Grant.

Ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops.  A runny eye just stares.

Grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his
hand.  These weeds have little purple berries.  Ellie looks over.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          West Indian Lilacs!

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          These'd give anybody a stomachache.

<b>                            HARDING
</b>          I'm telling you, the animals don't eat
          don't eat that stuff.

Regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids.  Timmy comes up with a
handful of smooth stones.  He approaches Grant shyly.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Dr. Grant, sir?  How 'bout these?
          There'
s lots of little piles of these?

Grant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Hey, Ellie take a look at his.  Good
          work, Timmy.

Ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Extremely smooth.  Purple stains, could
          be those lilac berries.

She and Grant smile and each other and nod.  Gennaro is curious.

<b>                            HARDING
</b>          I don't get it.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Looks like your trike swallows stones to
          help her digest her food.  Walking
          around, she crushes berries against the
          stones.  And even just a little crushed
          berry is eventually enough,

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          So, she poisons herself periodically.

<b>                            HARDING
</b>          Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          But with th
e stones, she swallows them
          and probably bypasses any mucosal
          contact.  Straight to the stomach.  I
          would test her excrement.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Yo, yuk!

A light RAIN begins.  Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs
of the cruisers slide shit.  Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          Hey Regis, where are your rain gods?
          It's gonna pour.  Let's finish our tour.

Grant agrees, heads for the cruisers.  He turns and looks for Ellie.
Ellie stands by the Trike.  She gives Grant a meaningful look.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          I'm staying.

Grant smiles at her decision.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Soil samples?

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          You read my mind.
              (confidentially)
          I think she's sicker then they're saying.
          Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums
          are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.

<b>        
</b><b>                    GRANT
</b>          Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open.

Gennaro climbs in with Grant.  The two cruisers start off and Timmy
turns backward to stare wistfully at Grant.  Regis and Lex wave to the
Trike.  Grant looks back to Ellie who has already begun to work.

ON TRIKE - a mosquito lands on its back.  The trike's tail slaps it dead.


<b>INT  MACHINE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
With difficulty, Nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind
a large rack of electronic equipment.  He stops and uses a suction cup
device to lift a section of the tiled floor.  He gropes among cables and
pulls out a small wireless radio.  He transmits:

<b>                            NEDRY (INTO RADIO)
</b>          Jim, what the hell's with you  ... I know
          a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so
          tightly planned ... that's not enough ...
          ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there.  Damn!

Nedry returns the radio to its hiding place.  He sucks in his gut to
make the crawl out of  the narrow space.


<b>INT/EXT  CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA - DUSK
</b>
The cruisers stop on the rise of a hill.  They over look a forested area,
sloping down to the edge of the lagoon.

<b>                            TOUR
</b>          The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur
          history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a
          hundred and twenty million years, but
          there were tyrannosaurs for only the last
          fifteen million years of that period ...

Farther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing
at the water's edge.  Their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface,
break apart with the continuing drops of rain.  Hear lightning rhythmic-
ally pulses the sky.  All is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas
and the tapping of light rain.

Regis calls Grant on the walkie-talkie.

<b>                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
</b>          You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to
          come here in the evening and just sit.

<b>                            GRANT (OVER WALKIE)
</b>          Where is the T-
Rex?

<b>                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
</b>          Good question.

ON GRANT - as he takes that in, nodding to himself. Studies the land.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.

OVER WALKIE - Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio.

<b>                            REGIS (OVER WALKIE)
</b>          Would if she could, believe me.  Some-
          times she stands by the lagoon and stares
          at those animals, and wiggles those
          little forearms of hers in frustration.
          But the T-Rex territory is completely
          enclosed with trenches and fences.
          Believe me, she can't go anywhere.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Then where is she?

They hear A SOFT BLEATING.  In the center of the field, a small cage
rises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.  The cage bars
slide down.  A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively.

The tour group stares out their windows, expectantly.


<b>BACK ON CONTRO
</b><b>L ROOM -
</b>
Hammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group.
Muldoon limps into the control room.  Arnold looks over.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Just checking in.  Everything ok?

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Look at them.  Leaning out the windows,
          so eager.  They can't wait to see it.
          They have come for the danger.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          That's what I'm afraid of.

Muldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers.


<b>BACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA -
</b>
Grant watches quietly.

The BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent.  The goat tugs frantically
at its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          What's going to happen to the goat?  Is
          the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?

Grant senses something.  He sits straight up.  Looks out intently.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          He's here.

The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi
eld, thirty yards from the
nearest tree.  Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex.

The goat senses something too.  It struggles and strains, bleating
frantically.  Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up.  Its
bars surround the goat with safety once again.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Looks like the Rex will have its snack a
          little later today.

<b>                            RECORDED VOICE
</b>          The sensors don't see the Rex around.
          She usually comes within five minutes of
          hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that
          means she's sleeping - we might have
          access to her at the picnic area.

Lex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief.  The tension is gone.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I
          liked the goat.


<b>BACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM -
</b>
Hammond studies the large video monitor.  He watches Grant and Gennaro.
Their voices are heard in the control room.

<b>                            GENNARO (MONITOR
</b><b>ED)
</b>          What is a carnivore got out?

<b>                            GRANT (MONITORED)
</b>          There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no
          natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting
          instinct.

Hammond glares.  Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Damn those people.  They are so negative.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          It's natural.  They can't fully
          appreciate that we've engineered the
          animals and the park for total safety.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          They comb this island like a bunch of
          accountants.  They don't experience the
          wonder, the awe of it all.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          You can't make people experience wonder.

Hammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park.
The quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow and
the dark jungle is opened again to their inspection.

At his console, Nedry looks at Hamm
ond.  Hammond stares out the window.
The RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window.  Hammond speaks to Arnold
without turning.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          It's like the Garden of Eden out there.
          This is the most beautiful time of day.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Better rout the tour back.  They can
          start again sun-up tomorrow morning.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be
          hungry when they get in.

Arnold picks up the phone.  STATIC.  He glances over at Nedry.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the
          lines to upload some data.

Hammond's annoyed, but contains it.  Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          I'll clear a couple of lines for you at
          the end of the next transmission, sir.
          Here you go now, this will make it all
          better, Mr. Hammond.

Nedry punches in a code.

<b>CLOSE ON 
</b>- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key.

CLOSE ON - amber video display terminal as a countdown begins.

As the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond with
a steely glint in his eyes.

BACK ON SCREEN - three, two, one, the countdown hits zero.

Nedry's data-filled screen blinks off.  Nedry looks up to the rack of
monitors.  Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank.
Then a third one.


<b>BACK  ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - NIGHT
</b>
The electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the
park.  HUGE QUARTZ LIGHTS REVEAL a dramatic view down to the ocean.
There the supply ship, the ANNE B, unloads its last crates.

RAIN INCREASES.  On the other side of the road are picnic tables, an
unfinished snack bar and rest rooms.  To the side of this rest area is a
view of the interior of the island.  A guard-rail separates visitors

To the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of
this is a tall, electrified fence.  Surrounding the electric fence is a

smaller protective fence.

<b>                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE
</b>          ... enjoy a healthy snack.  This is also
          a good time to ...

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Hey, is that bathroom working?

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Sure.
              (he uses his walkie)
          Rest stop.

The kids take off towards the bathroom, running through the rain.  Grant
gets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis.  He indicates the fence.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Is that still the T-Rex paddock?

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't
          know why not.  Probably too much
          construction.

GENNARO, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean.

GENNARO'S POV - THE ANNE B UNLOADS he last cargo crate.

GRANT LOOKS at the concrete moat.  Studies its deep curve.  He looks up
at the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning.  He sees
conventional power lines on the opposite sid
e of the road.

CAMERA EXAMINES the empty cruisers.  Inside, the pre-recorded voice is
chatting on.  It slows eerily and stops.  Video SCREENS BLINK OUT.


<b>BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -
</b>
Nedry yawns loudly.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend
          for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke.
          Don't touch my console, ok?  Line will
          be clear in five minutes.

Nedry leaves.  Hammond swings around and growls under his breath.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Slob!

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Well, at least he knows what he's doing.


<b>INT  UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - NIGHT
</b>
Nedry races through the series of security doors.  He ignores the
security x-ray device and just SHOVES each door open with his hand.


<b>BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -
</b>
THE QUARTZ LIGHTS GO OUT, leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now
STEADY RAIN.  There's a ripple of surprise from the group.  Regis rounds
them all up and directs them back into the 
cruisers.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary
          glitch due to the rain.  No doubt,
          they're going to re-rout some circuits
          back at the mainframe.  We'll have the
          power back on in moments.  Let's get back
          in the cruisers, they may start up, and
          I'd like us all to be seated in them.

The cruisers are STILL.  IN THE REAR CRUISER, Gennaro turns to Grant.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          I knew we shouldn't have kids here.

A vivid FLASH of LIGHTNING.  IN THE FIRST CAR:  Lex covers her eyes.
Then she looks up at Regis with a frightful face.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          No, darling, of course not.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Mr. Regis?  What's ... nocturnal?

Another LIGHTNING FLASH.  Lex cries.  Regis comforts her.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Don't you worry about d
inosaurs.  They're
          all very safe in their paddocks just like
          animals in a big, strong zoo.  They're not
          going anywhere we don't tell them to go.

Timmy looks out the window excitedly.


<b>INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT
</b>
All those eggs on tables.  No moving sensors.  Nedry pulls a portable
incubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall.  Its
electrical cord goes flying.  Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator with
eggs, one after the other.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Okay, little ones!  Here we go!

Nedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it.  The
incubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits.


<b>BACK ON CONTROL ROOM -
</b>
Hammond looks out the large window as the LIGHTS EXTINGUISH.  He twirls.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          What's going on, Arnold?  I want those
          lights on.  I don't want my grandchildren
          scared.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Jesus, the computer's gone
 down.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Well, I want the computer up.  This is
          the wrong weekend for glitches.

Arnold still examines his console.  He looks out with worry.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          That's not the worst of it.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Oh yeah?  Please tell me what's worse
          than the lights going out?

Wu smashes through the door.

<b>                            WU
</b>          All the security doors are open.  Someone
          has been in my laboratory and the eggs
          have been disturbed.

The camera pushes in on Hammond's face.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he?
          Did anybody check the damn john?

Hammond storms out.


<b>INT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION
</b>
Hammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells:

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut
          the power?

<b>     
</b><b>                       HAMMOND
</b>          Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring
          back the tour right away.  I don't need
          any of this!

Muldoon is already running back the way he came.


<b>INT  GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There
is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault
rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters.

To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side
of the front seat is a rocket launcher.

Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens.
Approaching FOOTSTEPS.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Oh, shit!


<b>INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -
</b>
Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the
door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.

BACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.
Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With
everything he's got, he lifts the incub
ator waist-height.  And holds it.

BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer
to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket
catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.

BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll
down his brow.

MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.

Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty
palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful
boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.

NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and
that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the
incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.

At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.

NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.  
Nedry's frightened face.

MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He
takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.

NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,
and zooms into the night.

A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust
that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his
jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his
face straining to understand.


<b>EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.

His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a
smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.

Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric
fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!

Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to
the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,
and another.  It f
its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.

Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the
ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.

CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the
muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.

He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his
face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.

He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.

Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.
He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates
move recklessly in the stormy night.


<b>BACK ON GARAGE
</b>
Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is
waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding
jumps out of the jeep.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.
          There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,
          Hammond'll fill you in.

Ellie is concerned, the
n decisive.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.

They race out.


<b>EXT  DOCK - NIGHT
</b>
Headlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the
dock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave.  The water is very choppy.

Nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground.  He begins to
drag it through the mud, toward the ship.  CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to meet
him, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carry
it toward the ship.

<b>                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
</b>          Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Nah.  I'm back in five minutes, they'll
          never know I was gone.
              (yells after the men with the incubator)
          Careful with that thing!  It's worth more
          than the ship.
              (to the Captain)
          When's the copter meeting you?

<b>                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
</b>          It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,
<b>       
</b>   nobody could land on the water.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>              (totally panicked)
          Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like
          this.  Maybe we should do it another time,
          I don't like it.  I just don't like -

<b>                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
</b>          Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at
          the dock in Puntaremas.  We should be
          able to make that in time.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>              (somewhat relieved)
          Ten hours?

<b>                            CAPTAIN FARRELL
</b>          Yeah, now relax.  I got a lot riding on
          this too, you know.  No one's going to
          mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess
          up.  His people won't let him.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Ok.  Ok.  Here.

Nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Look, this is insulating spray.

CLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his
 hand,

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          In about eight hours, spray down all the
          eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em
          warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has
          it together with the dock.


<b>BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -
</b>
Rain drums down on the cruiser.  Timmy stares out at the dark.  Lex
stares nervously out the side window.  Timmy picks up the night goggles
and snaps them on.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Hey, these thing work great.  I can see
          in the dark and I can see far.

He swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean.
He reaches up and adjusts the knob.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still
          there?  It is. I think they're getting
          ready to go.

TIM'S POV - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on
the boat.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and Lex SCREAMS and covers her face.  She cries.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Timmy, can you
 give her the goggles?

Lex clamps her hands over her eyes.  Timmy gently nudges her.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Want to look at the boat, Lex?

Timmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek
with the goggles toward the ocean.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he
          gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?

LEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at
the Captain.  Men heave the incubator onto the ship.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          They have one of those things from the

<b>                            TIMMY (TO WALKIE)
</b>          Uh, Dr. Grant?

REGIS GRABS th
e walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy.  He knows he
gets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          We saw that computer guy helping 'em load
          an incubator onto the ship.

</b>          Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!
          He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!

<b>                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)

</b>              (finally acknowledges)
          That's what they saw.

ON GRANT - He looks sharply at Gennaro.

<b>                            GRANT (TO WALKIE)
</b>          We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right
          away.  How far is it to the mainland?

ON TIMMY - He looks at Regis.

<b>                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)
</b>          Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas.
          About a sixteen hour voyage in this
          weather.

ON GRANT - He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser.  No r
esponse still.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running
          around Costa Rica.

</b>          When's the damn power coming on?


<b>INT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROADS
</b>
Muldoon and Ellie drive into the storm.  Suddenly, he slams on his
brakes.  In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the
road.  Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop.

As Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself
between the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs
and moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree.
As they struggle.

<b>                            MULDOON

<b>BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -

IN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears
his goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around,
trying to get comfortable to rest.

</b>          When the electricity comes back on,
          honey.  These cars run on electric cables
          buried in the road.

IN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes.
Grant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out
the car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all.

TIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around.
He puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car
VIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the
floor.  The kids look at him.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Must be turning on the electricity.

Lex sits up, looks around groggily.

</b>          Feels like a vibration.


<b>INT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT

The T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after
the other in long, powerful strides.


<b>BACK ON CRUISE
</b><b>RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER
</b>
There is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a
frightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND,
the whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles.

TIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence.

Tim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and
thick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand.

The T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence.


<b>IN THE SECOND CRUISER -
</b>
Grant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness.


<b>CLOSE ON LEX -
</b>
Tears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear.
Regis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Jesus Christ.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Is that bad?

Regis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex.

Regis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and
bolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex.

Regis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him.

<b>                            TIM
</b>          Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you
          going?

          alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do
          that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone!

FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head.

TIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser.

Timmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car.


<b>IN THE SECOND CRUISER -
</b>
GRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the
fallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur
ther, causing its
electric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings.


<b>TIMMY REACHES -
</b>
out into the rain for the open door handle.

Another LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between
the two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and
forth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex?

Timmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few
feet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back.

Lex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth.

There is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie.

<b>                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)
</b>          Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.


<b>BACK ON GRANT -
</b>
He snaps off the walkie-talkie.

HIS POV - The rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the
muscular hind legs.  The animal's head is out-of-view, above the
rooftops of the cars.  The Rex lifts its huge hind leg.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do
          now?

<b>                            GRANT
</b><b>        
</b>  Can't think of a thing.

The T-Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser.


<b>BACK ON TIM -
</b>
He watches the beast move.


<b>BACK ON GRANT AND GENNARO -
</b>
As they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain.
The Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window.  He lowers his head,
looking for movement inside.

CLOSE ON - the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket.

Grant whispers, hardly moving his lips.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Don't move.

Gennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably.


<b>IN THE FIRST CRUISER -
</b>
Very frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight.  She flicks it on and off,
distracting herself.  The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          It's too, too dark out there.

Tim waves his hands in caution.


<b>BACK ON GRANT, GENNARO, AND THE REX -
</b>
The Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose.  Just stays
there, breathing heavily.  In the distance, the flashlight goes on
again.  The Rex raises his head suddenly.  Grant g
rabs his walkie.

<b>                            GRANT (TO THE WALKIE)
</b>          Shut that flashlight, Tim!

As the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail SMASHES the side of the
cruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car.


<b>ON TIM -
</b>
He lunges for the flashlight.  Lex dodges him, keeps it lit.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          No, it's mine.  Please, I need it.

Tim looks up through the sun roof.  The massive head of the
Tyrannosaurus Rex appears.  Tim watches, transfixed.  Lex looks up.
Irrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun.  Blasts him.
Her flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast
plainly for the first time and SCREAMS!

The POOL OF LIGHT bathes the Rex's face.  He smashes his head down onto
the Plexiglass bubble.  It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing
the children.  Tim uses his feet to push it to the side.

Above, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening.


<b>GRANT -
</b>
watches the Rex raise his mighty h
ead again, above the kids' cruiser.


<b>TIMMY AND LEX -
</b>
have a half-instant of relief.  Then SLAM.  The Rex butts his head
against the cruiser.  The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his
prey inside the cruiser.  Pushes his head close to the glass, looking.

The dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving,
his forelimbs pawing the air.

Timmy whispers to Lex.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move.

Lex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand.

The Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car.  He begins to shove the
cruiser with his head.  The cruiser ROCKS.  The back window bursts,
shards go flying.

Inside, the kids are THROWN back and forth, SHOVED against each other,
and finally FLUNG against the top of the car as the cruiser FLIPS.

The whole world TILTS CRAZILY - trunks of palm trees slide by, the
ground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees.

The cruiser SLAMS DOWN on its side, the windows splat in the mud.  Lex
falls he
lplessly against the side window and lies motionless.  Timmy
falls beside her, banging his head.  He reaches for Lex.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>              (softly)
          Lex?  Lex?

SILENCE.  No movement from Lex.

THE ANIMAL toys with the cruiser.  Like a dog with its bone, the
dinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head.  He pushes it past the
picnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment.  Each shove
sends the children flying again.

The cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment.
The cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down.  The T-Rex steps
right on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground.

INSIDE - the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further
down from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides.

THE REX - gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures
with a pitiful pop.  The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to
drag the car back.  THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car.



<b>GRANT DANCES -
</b>
with a flare!  The Rex is distracted.

CLOSE ON - the Rex as he ROARS.  The flare gleams in his eyes.

The Rex starts toward Grant.  He tosses the flare over the half-standing
part of the fence.  The Rex lunges after the flare.

GENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS:

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          Extinct animals should stay extinct!

He bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant,
who stays frozen in place.

Gennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T-
Rex jogging behind him.

Gennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM.

INSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door.
POUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls.
LOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck'
position.

ON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad
door.  Pieces go flying.

Gennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around.


<b>GRANT RUNS BA
</b><b>CK -
</b>
to check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car,
sitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard.

<b>                            LEX (OFF)
</b>          Dr. Grant!

Grant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks
her for broken bones.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Lex, are you okay?

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Timmy's unconscious, he won't move.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight.
The animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser!

The Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him.
He SCREAMS.

Lex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Timmy!

The Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens
its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex.

INSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of
blood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the
 crushed roof and
the bent bench seat.  He can't free himself.

The Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up
but they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment.
But if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car.

Grant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and
digs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed
fence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop!

Grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of
the embankment.

Just in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser
TEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway
out of the car, unable to get out further.

Grant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the
embankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex
looks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly.

Grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall
and
 swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and -

- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as -

- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy
and the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS!

Grant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex
SCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as
the cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree
at the base of the wall.

Grant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.
Grant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Let ... go ... please.

The Rex ROARS above.  They look up.

THE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING
<b>FLASHES.
</b>

<b>EXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS -
</b>
Nedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes.

CLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel.

NEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link
fence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur
s across the road.

Nedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring
the careening jeep under control.

The jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and
dives into a raging gully.

Nedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The
jeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he
cranes his head around, examining his situation.

NEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment
graveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around
can be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors.

Nedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end.
and wades over to an abandoned tractor.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes.

He loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and
looks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the
strange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli
ghts.

HOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE.

Nedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops,
looks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks.

Looking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in
the eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry
warily, hunting him.  Nedry stares.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          I hope this is one of them herbivores.

Nedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt.  Hop, hop, and the Spitter
drops in front of Nedry from the other side.  HOOT!

Nedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side
<b>- HOOT!
</b>
Nedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and
rolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down
the embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to
steady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep,
swings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a
 demonic
apparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare
of the headlights!

CLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out
like an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws.

A big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          Gross.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares
out, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits.

This glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight.

VERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated.
They fire!

This glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS.

<b>                            NEDRY
</b>          I'm blind, I'm blind.

He falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to
the embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the
water.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the
driver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him.

Nedry pulls open the jeep door, 
thrusts his head in, slams it against
the door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The
Spitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it
closes it on Nedry.

Nedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently
turns his blind eyes that way.

A long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND
WIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.


<b>INT  TIMMY'S CRUISER
</b>
Timmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the
door handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and
tries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him

Timmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A
CREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a
further effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet
on the window frame and looks out the broken roof.

TIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An
o
pen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY!


<b>INT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION
</b>
Tim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a
tree on the hillside.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Oh shit!

Timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He
grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand.

CRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the
window frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind.

CRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

Timmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up
the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Timmy.  Are you ok?

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex?

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down.

Timmy nods.

Grant peers throug
h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's
predicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is
supported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Try the door you're leaning against.
          Nice and slow.

Timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches
between his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The
cruiser drops another foot.

Grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser
again.  He motions for Timmy to hold still.

Grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door
handle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant
gingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Crawl this way.  Slowly.

Carefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down.
He pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come
to rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si
ts on a
branch, a few feet below the cruiser.

CRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his
footing on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser
hangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          We're going to have to make a jump for
          it, Timmy.  Okay?

Timmy agrees.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          One, two, three, jump.

Timmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's
hurtling right at them.

Timmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP
against his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES
them.  They scramble down as quick as they can.

Timmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK!
Grant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he
flips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a
half-step behind them.

Timmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth 
with a THUD!  Grant
CRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser
keeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it.

GRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally
stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked
headlight glaring.

Oil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles.
The two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground.

Grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy
slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Thanks, Dr. Grant.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          You owe me one.

Grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Where'd Lex go?

They hear a faint WHIMPERING.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          There's Lex.

He runs.  Grant follows.


<b>INT  DRAINPIPE -
</b>
Lex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her
mouth and
 she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head
against the back of the pipe.  She WHIMPERS.

<b>ON THE HILLSIDE -
</b>
Grant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Come on out now, Lex.

Lex continues to band her head.  Timmy tries again.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex.

She shakes her head.  He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          I found your baseball.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          You did?

But she doesn't move.  Grant speaks encouragingly.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there.
          And tight.  Why don't you come out?

<b>                            LEX
</b>          I'm afraid of the "animals".

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          The "animals" are gone.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Where did it go?

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          I don't kno
w but it's not here now.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Are there any grownups out there?

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie
          you hand, come on, here you go.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          I'm hungry.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back
          to civilization.


<b>EXT  ROADSIDE
</b>
Regis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks
around carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck.

He touches his cheek.

CLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly,
he swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with
blood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his
arm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and
pulls out another.  He SCREAMS.

As soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks
around frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward 
him.

<b>                            REGIS
</b>          Noooooo!


<b>BACK ON HILLSIDE -
</b>
Grant and the kids crest the hill.  Grant puts on the night goggles and
adjusts the dial and looks toward Regis.  The kids can't see that far.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          What's going on?

Grant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him.  Regis hugs a
tree, unmoving.

Grant whispers to the kids.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But
          it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see
          him.  Evidently, he can only see move-
          ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still.

AFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the
shadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree.

GRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis
to the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him
right back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.

<b>                            REGIS
</b><b>    
</b>      You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go
          away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off!

THE REX watches him dance around.  It goes toward him.  This time its
jaws are open.  Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off.

Grant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a
METALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Let's go!

Grant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run.


<b>BACK ON  TOUR REST AREA -
</b>
Drops of water splat on a big fern.  Light swims in the little puddle.
In the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half-
obscured moon.

The torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess.  The wheel of a Land
Cruiser spins.  A little lizard runs in place on it.

The SOUND of the jeep's engine.  It's Muldoon and Ellie.

THEIR POV - a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Oh, My God!  Where's the other one?

Before the cruiser stops, she j
umps out.   Muldoon shouts a whisper.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Ellie!

Ellie turns in the headlight beams.  Muldoon tosses her a flashlight.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Wait up.

Muldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car.  He catches up to Ellie.

They share a frightened, apprehensive look.  Muldoon gets on his knees
and and touches a muddies area.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          T-Rex tracks.

Ellie looks out into the forest.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Then they must be out there.  They must
          be out there.  I know it.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Perhaps.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          No!  They're out there.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the
          bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to
          see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or
          exposed bones.  There is usually little or
          no evidence left behind.  And if
 victims
          are small, a predator can kill by just
          shaking the little thing to death, eating
          it, and leave not so much as a button.

A definite RUSTLING in the brush.

Ellie jumps and SCREAMS.  Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and
pushes her down.  They both squat by the cruiser.  SILENCE.  Ellie
swallows.  Muldoon slowly gets up.  Ellie follows.

Their flashlights swing back and forth in the night.  Twigs crack under
their feet.

Ellie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest.  She shines her light
into the brush.  She catches her breath.  Her hand shakes.

Ellie flashes her beam right, left, up, down.  Jumps.  Something is
coming at her, rolling at her.  She gasps, steps back.  It's too late.
It's Gennaro.  His limp body stops at her feet.  She covers her mouth.
Muldoon runs to her.

Gennaro is face-down.  Muldoon takes his pulse.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Thank God.  (beat)  We have to carry him.
          First I have to ...

He stands and removes his 
jacket.

CLOSE ON - Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips.

He wraps Gennaro's wounds.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me.

Muldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep.  They lay him on the back
seat.  Muldoon jumps in back with him.  He keeps wrapping the wounds.
Ellie starts the engine, looks back at him.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Looks like you've been through this
          before.

Muldoon looks up.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          I told you I've seen big game attacks in
          Africa.

She starts the engine.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Right.

Ellie skids out of there.


<b>INT  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The dark room is lit with two outdoor torches.  Light flickering on
their faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen.

<b>                            WU
</b>          Why?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Because Nedry messed with the code.
          That's why I'm checking it.

<b>              
</b><b>              WU
</b>          But that could take weeks.  What would be
          faster?  Try keychecks.

Arnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu,

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          That's true.  Keychecks will give me a
          record of every button Nedry pushed.

With a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates "keystrokes".  The
computer displays a short series of commands.  Arnold runs his finger
down the screen.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon?
          He was just dicking around, maybe waiting
          to get his nerve up.

Wu points to a line.  It reads:  WHTE-RBT.OBJ

<b>                            WU
</b>          What's that?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can
          trace it.

Arnold types FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  Nothing.  He tries DEFINE WHTE-RBT.OBJ.
Still nothing.  LIST WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  The screen fills with data.  Each
line defines another security system that has been shut off:  SECURITY
<b>PERIM
</b><b>ETER FENCES OFF/   SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/  SECURITY -
</b>LABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc.

<b>                            WU
</b>          What's it mean?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that
          fat bastard left for himself.  When he
          hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of
          commands that turned the whole goddamn
          park off.  Hammond was right about him.

<b>                            WU
</b>          If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it
          back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure
          Nedry did.  You're find it.

Arnold nods grimly.


<b>INT  CAFETERIA - NIGHT
</b>
Hammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice
cream into his mouth.  This room is lit by dozens of candles.

Muldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.
          Harding's tending to him in your
          quarters.  He'll be all right if we can
<b>    
</b>      radio for help.  Your grandchildren and
          Grant are somewhere in the park.  I
          believe they're alive but I don't know
          where they are.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          I'm sure you'll find them.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          I certainly hope so.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          I'm sure we will.  After all, I keep
          telling everyone, this park is made for
          children.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Just so you understand that they're
          missing, sir.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Missing?  Of course I know they're
          missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob,
          let's not get carried away.  We've had a
          little breakdown from the storm or
          whatever, and as a result we've had a
          regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And
          that's all that happened.  We're dealing
          with it.  Arnold will get the computers
          cleaned up, and
 the radio and phone lines
          open.  You'll find those kids and my good
          friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want
          some of this ice cream.  It's very good.


<b>INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
Dark.  Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch.
Blood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather.  Gennaro babbles.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          That Rex didn't even give me his full
          attention.  That's what hurts.  I was
          just an afterthought.  I gave him my full
          attention.

<b>                            HARDING
</b>          He's had a lot of morphine.

          Not enough.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          I need to find Wu.  I have to run a few
          tests in his lab.

<b>                            HARDING
</b>          He's probably in the control room, get-
          ting in the way while Arnold tries to put
          things together.

As Ellie leaves, Genna
ro is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor.

<b>                            GENNARO
</b>          Yo ho, I'll close this place down ...


<b>EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - NIGHT
</b>
The ship is tossed around on a stormy sea.

<b>INT  STATEROOM -
</b>
The eggs are tossed around in the womb of the incubator.  The swell
settles but the rocking of one egg doesn't stop.  The egg cracks, a
silvery line runs down its side.


<b>EXT  PARK - NIGHT
</b>
Somewhere in the dark park, laced by low fog, Grant, Timmy and Lex walk.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          I'm tired.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          You're too big to be carried.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          But I'm tired-tired.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Okay, Lex.

Grant picks her up.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Oof!  You're heavy.

The full moon is blurred by drifting clouds.  Their blunted shadows lead
the three across an open field toward dark woods beyond
.  Grant is lost
is thought, trying to decide where to go.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          I think we're still in his paddock.

Lex's heavy eyes open.  Her eyes grow big.  She taps Grant's shoulder.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          What?

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Don't you see?  Don't you see?

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          What?

<b>                            LEX
</b>          The fence.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>              (squinting)
          No.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Oh I do, right there!

Lex lets herself slide off Grant and runs into the woods.  Timmy
follows.  Grant follows, squinting.  Finally, he sees.  A big smile.

The kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence.  Timmy gulps.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Timmy's scared of heights.

Timmy spins in fury.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Shut up.

Lex and Timmy stare at each other.  No fighting - now.  They relax.

<b>                   
</b><b>         GRANT
</b>          Okay with the fence, Timmy?

Timmy eyes it.  Nods hesitantly.  They start to climb.  Lex climbs easily.

<b>                            LEX
</b>              (mumbles quietly)
          'Fraid of heights.

Timmy climbs tentatively.  A dinosaur ROARS in the distance.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's foot loses its grip.

Timmy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands.

All three stop.  Wait.  Timmy regains his balance.  Slowly, they proceed
up and over.

On the other side, Grant looks around.  More high trees.  Beyond a field.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          A herbivore grazing area.  Excellent.

Grant starts to walk toward it.  Timmy stops.  Lets sits on a tree root.

<b>                             TIM
</b>          We gonna walk all night?

Grant looks at his watch.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Twelve hours before that ship reaches the
          mainland.

<b>                            TIM
</b>          We need sleep.

True, and Grant's thinking the same thing.  He looks aro
und, surveying
the misty forest.  He looks straight up into the beautiful, tall trees
that ring the wide-open grassy meadow.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Up there.

<b>                            TIM
</b>          Climb?  Again?  I can't climb again?

Grant smiles.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Sure you can.

Grant checks out and rejects tree after tree.  Near the meadow he finds
it.  A good, basic climbing tree.


<b>EXT  UPPER BRANCHES OF THE TREE
</b>
Grant helps Lex get comfortable on his lap.  Timmy tucks himself in
between Grant's outstretched legs.  Grant looks out.  Back to kids.

Timmy and Lex are already snoring.  Lex turns and hugs Grant close to
her.  She murmurs in her sleep.  Grant starts to pat her shoulder when
Timmy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>              (mumbles)
          It's ok, Lex.  Everything's gonna be okay.

CLOSE ON - amoeba-like creatures 
swimming in a pool.


<b>INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT
</b>
Ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope.

The dark room is lit by flashlight.  Battery packs power the microscope.
Wu paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay.  Sitting on their
long tables with no moving wands above them - no thermal sensors.

<b>                            WU
</b>          What is taking Arnold so long?  This room
          is too cold.  My eggs will be damaged.

Ellie swings the lens to Wu.  Not so interested but peers in politely.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          No sign of those berries.  Really
          interesting.  There are indications of a
          similar virus in every tissue sample.
          But it's not in the ground.  Could I look
          at some of the discarded embryos?

Wu reluctantly agrees.  He opens a cabinet and brings her samples.

<b>                            WU
</b>          I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a
          similar one.  All animals carry many

in a dormant condition.  It's
          almost impossible to say with certainty
          which are the same strains.

Ellie begins a test on a sample.  She adds a reagent and marks up a
slide.  As she works:

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          And yet from what Harding tells me, many
          of you animals have similar symptoms -
          besides the microvesicles, a lack of
          hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores
          in the mouth and gums.

Wu waves his arms.

<b>                            WU
</b>          What the hell does Harding know?  He's a
          veterinarian, not a pathologist.


<b>BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -

Arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as
Muldoon walks in.  Muldoon asks hopefully.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          What is it?

Arnold points to the screen.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          That's it.

Muldoon comes closer.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          That's what?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Right.  And it does something else. It
          erases the code lines that refer to it.  It
          destroys all evidence it was ever there.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and
          reset the whole show.  No one would ever
          miss him.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Watch this.

Arnold types in a command.  The screen flickers and changes.  Arnold and
Muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Hot damn!

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Are the fences back on?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          You bet they are.  It will take a few
          seconds to get up to full power, because
          we've got fift
y miles of fence out there,
          and the generator has to feed the
          capacitors along the way.  But in a half
          a minute we'll be back in business.

Arnold points to the transparent map of the park.  On it, bright red
lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges
through the fences.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Motion sensors?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Got them too.   It will be a few minutes
          while the computer counts.  Then I'll
          tell you where Grant and the kids are and
          you can go and get them.  But every-
          thing's working.  Half past ten and we've
          got the whole thing back up and running.

Muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Just hiss.


<b>BACK ON  GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE -
</b>
Grant snores.  A mosquito buzzes around him.  He waves him away and
continues to sleep.

In the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across the
f
ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops.

IN THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway.  Grant and the kids sleep on.


<b>BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -
</b>
The glowing, glass map.  Arnold and Muldoon stare at it.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          What is taking so damn long?  Where are they?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          There's a lot of extraneous movement out
          there.  Branches blowing, birds, back-
          ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay,
          count's finished.

Muldoon looks at Arnold anxiously.  Arnold looks down.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're
          out of range of a sensor.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I
          wish I could go out there   But I haven't
          got anything to use on the Rex.  My
          rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry
          stole.  And going out with a big gun in
          the dark would be suicide

<b>INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT
</b>
Brightly lit again.  Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge.  She looks
at Wu, who sits across from her in a high stool, stifling a yawn.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu?
          I'm just going to run a couple more tests
          and then I'm going to turn in myself.

Wu doesn't need to be told twice.  He climbs off his stool.

<b>                            WU
</b>          No point in everyone being exhausted.

He starts to leave.  He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie.

<b>                            WU
</b>          I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as
          soon as there is light.

Ellie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work.

Beautiful dark ocean.  The sky is a rich blue.  A morning star fades as

Eggs sit in the incubator.  A hand sprays them with foam.  Leaves.
CAMERA EXAMINES the eggs as the foam disperses.  More cracks.  One egg
jumps with a bolt from within.  It settles.  Jumps again.

<b>EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAWN
</b>
Muldoon drives out into the park in Harding's jeep.  THREE WORKERS
travel with him.  Each carries a rifle.


<b>EXT  GRANT'S TREE - DAWN
</b>
CAMERA LOOK DOWN on Grant, Lex and Timmy still sleeping in the tree.  A
large shadow falls on their quiet faces.  Lex opens an eye. She SCREAMS.

Grant and Timmy wake up with a start.

THEIR POV - AS THE CAMERA LOOKS THROUGH THEIR LEGS AND TILTS UP right
into the huge face of A DUCK-BILLED HADROSAUR, a gigantic dinosaur with
cow eyes.  Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees.  Then the
head swoops way down below.  And returns to Grant's level and stares at
his shoe.

The hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe.  The kids
 press tightly into Grant.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          He gonna eat us?

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          I don't think so.  She's a ...

<b>                            GRANT AND TIMMY
</b>          ... herbivore.

The hadrosaur HONKS.  Lex covers her ears.  Grant smiles and motions to
Lex.  He picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the
hadrosaur's mouth.  CHOMP.  He feeds it again.  Lex and Timmy toss a few.

<b>CHOMP!  CHOMP!  HONK!  HONK!
</b>
The hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone.

When she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into
her mouth.  The hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit.
She pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and
moves down.

Grant, Lex and Timmy strain to see through the branches.

THEIR POV - The hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs.
Letting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs.  Lex YELLS:

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Come here, babies!  Get your b
reakfast!

The babies run to the base of the tree.  The kids toss fruits right down
to them.  Lex and Timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands.

Grant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other.  She sniffs his
foot.  He moves closer, straddling a branch.  He lifts up her lip and
examines her gums.

CLOSE ON - a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth.

Grant yanks it out.  He lets it drop to the ground.  He take a large
leaf and rubs her teeth with it.

CLOSE ON - her mouth as Grant's hand touches the side of her tongue.  He
sees little tiny bumps.

The hadrosaur lets out a low groan.   Grant is puzzled, rubs harder.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Like the trike.  Maybe it's not the stones.

HONK!   She pulls her mouth away.  The baby hadrosaurs turn to the
honking adult.  She is leaving quickly.  They follow quickly behind her.
The small herd leaves, casually trampling trees as they go.


<b>EXT  BACK ROADS, PARK - MORNING
</b>
Muldoon and workers drive rapidly in the jeep.  Suddenly,
 Muldoon slams
on the brakes.

MULDOON'S POV - ABOUT TWENTY PROCOMPSOGNATHIDS (COMPYS), small chicken-
sized scavenging dinosaurs, scramble across the road.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Where the hell are they going?

Muldoon watches them cross.  He thinks it over.  Spins the wheel and
follows them off the road.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Let's see what's up.


<b>EXT  BELOW THE TREE, PARK - MORNING
</b>
Timmy bravely jumps from a very low branch.  He smiles and looks at
Grant, who's already on the ground.  Grant looks off in the distance.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Tim, I think there's a motion sensor
          across the field and down there.

<b>                            TIM
</b>          Where's Lex?

ALONE IN THE BUSHES -  Lex kneels.  She holds a big fruit and calls:

<b>                            LEX
</b>          C'mere boy, c'mere.

She tosses the fruit.

CLOSE ON - the fruit rolling away.

Lex gets up and follows the rolling fruit.  She picks it up.

<b>           
</b><b>                 LEX
</b>          It's very, very good.

She tosses it again.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          C'mere boy, c'mere.

Lex's eyes scan the bushes, then stop.  She smiles.

LEX'S POV - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex.

Lex pushes the fruit closer.  The BABY TRICERATOPS comes out of the
brush, squeaking as it goes.  It nibbles the fruit.  Lex rolls another.

BACK ON GRANT AND TIM - They look around.  Timmy stops, mouth open, YELLS:

<b>                            TIM
</b>          Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.

Grant turns, looks OFFSCREEN.  He's astonished by when he sees.

HIS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above.  As a break in
the shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops.  Loving it.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Whoa!

With a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops.

Lex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes.  Then beneath the
tall trees as she enters the forest.  She crosses a stream on a log
b
ridge.  Light showers down through the branches.  The water shimmers.
Lex in is paradise.

Behind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.  She waves, kicks the
triceratops like it's a horse and YELLS:

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Giddyup!

The trike takes off, in a rush.  It trips over a fallen tree, downed by
the storm.  The trike takes a spill and Lex goes flying.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Whoa!!  Take is easy!

She passes over the trike's head, in the air, and SCREAMS as she flies:

<b>                            LEX
</b>          I can't swim!

She SPLASHES into the stream.

Timmy, first to arrive on the scene, dives in heroically.  He comes up
sheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water.

The baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as
she goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath.

Timmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water.
The baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike.

<b>                 
</b><b>           GRANT
</b>          Go home now.  Home to Freda!

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Oh, let him stay.  He likes me to ride
          him.  He could carry me instead of you,
          Dr. Grant.  Please, let him stay,

Grant shakes his head,

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Go!  Go away.  Go!  Get out of here!

The trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on.  Lex is
heartbroken.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Will I ever play with him again?

Grant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning.
He has to keep them going.   He points across the field.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          We gotta get to that motion detector.
          It's still a ways.

Lex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd
eating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They
drink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the
still water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the
water's 
edge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back
while the adults watch indulgently.


<b>EXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING
</b>
Muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail
off in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to
track the different groups.

A BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a
small group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground.

A BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he
scatters them.

Muldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was
lost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger
side still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it.
When he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The
image is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          I found Nedry!

In the distance, the call is ECHOED.

<b>INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY
</b>
Hammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on
the couch.  Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope
          you're not going to take this little
          mishap you had and hold it against my
          park.  It would be terrible if the
          finishing funds were in any way held up.

Gennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He
wants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro
enthusiastically agrees with a nod.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          You really shouldn't have gotten out of
          the vehicle.  The park is actually quite
          safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged
          some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu,
          all loyal employees, are righting damage
<b>    
</b>      as we speak.

</b>          Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's
          more than we ever dreamed!  Those
          brachiosaurs are so big!  And those
          Spitters -
              (he spits)
          - incredible!  I only have one problem.
          Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?
              (he frowns, smacks his forehead)
          Oh, they'd fly away!

Gennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away.
Hammond takes out a bag.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you
          seen these?  These are great.

Hammond dumps things out of the bag.  They are souvenirs of the park.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas.

Gennaro is thrilled.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur
          bingo, hey ...

Hammond leans closer.

<b>

          souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only
          food we sell, of course.

Gennaro can't take it.  Great idea!  He high-fives Hammond repeatedly.

Harding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder.

<b>                            HARDING

          He's doped to infinity and back.


<b>INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DAY

Sunlight pours through the windows.  Ellie sits with her head in hands.
She looks around and wanders the lab.  Notices a drawer, slides it open.

X-rays.  She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA.

Ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station.  She studies the X-
ray.  She looks up in surprise.   Studies it again.

The viewing light is snapped off.  Ellie looks again.  Wu stands there.

<b>                            WU
</b>          Who gave you permission -

Ellie attacks back.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          I'm here to investigate this park. And
          there's
 plenty you haven't told me.

<b>                            WU
</b>          That's absurd.

<b>                            ELLIE

<b>                            WU
</b>          You're qualified to interpret x-rays of
          living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took
          me many months to learn.

<b>                            Y
</b>          I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't
          an adult, just a huge juvenile.

<b>                            WU
</b>          You're making a lot of assumptions here.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu?

They stare at each other in the bright sunlight.

<b>                            HAMMOND (OFF)
</b>          Growth hormones.

The two swing around.  Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.

<b>                            WU
</b>          She didn't have a right to explore my lab.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious
          problem.
              (to 
Ellie)
          These animals don't last.  There is a
          regularity, a predictability about when
          they die.  It's always ... very young.
          We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure
          Wu will figure it out.  It's just ...

<b>                            WU
</b>          Just some adjustment in the code is
          required.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          But there are deadlines.  The park opens
          next summer. And it requires full-grown
          specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to
          achieve the desired size in a short
          amount of time.  But they all keep dying
          and we don't know how to stop it.

Ellie and Wu stare at Hammond.  He steps forward.  The light is so hot
behind him that his appearance is like an apparition.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          I was going to tell you all this myself,
          Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped
          breathing down my neck.  That's why I
          wanted you and Dr. Grant 
here on my
          island - you have to help me keep the
          dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help
          me?

<b>                                                      CUT TO:

IN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds -


<b>INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY
</b>

Ellie enters.  On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly.  In a chair nearby
Harding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands.

Ellie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed.
She looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of
the park.  She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in.

She brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face.  Air
blows in and out of his dry lips.  She examines the gauze wrapped around
his wounded leg.  It seeps with blood.


<b>INT CONTROL - DAY
</b>
Arnold works at his console.  Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder.
Ellie bursts in, very agitated.  Hammond looks up.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. 
 He
          needs transfusions.  We gotta get a
          rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with
          the phones?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Ah hell. I just can't find it.

He sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Find what?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Nedry jammed all the communication lines.
          He inserted some command, a lockout into
          the program code.  I can't find it,
          because I gave that restore command and
          it erased part of the program listings.

<b>                            WU
</b>          So?  Just reset - shut the system down
          and you'll clear the memory.  Everything
          will be in the normal wakeup mode.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Shut the system down?

<b>                            WU
</b>          And reset.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          I've never done that before.  And I'm
          reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr
ue, all
          systems will come on, but maybe they won't.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Look, there is a sick man here who needs
          medical attention or he'll die.  Four
          people are out there, missing in your
          park.  We need search teams.  We have to
          have a phone or radio.

Arnold still hesitates.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Well?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Well, it's just that the safety systems
          don't function with the computer shut
          down and -

Ellie boils over.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          - turn the goddamn safety systems off!
          Can't you get it through your head that
          we have no choice?

Arnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park.  Without
turning, Hammond nods his consent.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Okay.

Arnold gets up and goes to the main panel.  He opens the doors and
uncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. 
 He pops them
off, one after another.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          You asked for it.  And you got it.

He throws the master switch.

The control room goes black.  All monitors go black.  Arnold, Wu and
Ellie stand in the dark.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          How long do we have to wait?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Thirty seconds.


<b>EXT  FIELD IN THE PARK -
</b>
Grant and kids walk through a clearing.  Lex stops.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          What is it?

<b>                            LEX
</b>          I hear something.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Come on.

Timmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are
motionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Hear it now?

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta
          get back and warn them about the boat.

Lex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw
een
Grant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it.

HONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the
honking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another
and another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          What's going on?

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          They're agitated.

The duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the
young ones to protect them.

With a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away
straight toward the hadrosaurs.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          I told you I heard something!

The earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin
to run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Outta the way, kids! Run!

Grant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like
a football.  Timmy runs beside them.

Hadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant
 hears the crashing of trees.
He takes a glance over his shoulder.

GRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd
into changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into
the path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM.


<b>BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -
</b>
The quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive
presence affects all in the room.

Arnold looks at his illuminated watch.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Memory should be cleared by now.

He pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Damn.

Arnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He
glances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          What's wrong?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches
          back on before I restart the power.

Arnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers.
Holding his breath, he
 turns on the main power switch.

First, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The
lights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Thank God!

The room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Arnold!  They're still not working.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all
          system modules have to be brought on line
          manually.

Arnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns.

<b>                            WU
</b>              (to Hammond)
          Arnold's about to get the phones up.

Arnold pushes the chair back.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Okay, we're up again!

Ellie grabs the phone back up.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          No we're not.  Phones still dead.

Arnold swings her way.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Can't be -

<b>                    
</b><b>        HAMMOND
</b>          My God, look at this, Arnold.

Hammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the
lagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          What's happening?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>              (tonelessly)
          The duckbills.

<b>                            WU
</b>          My good God.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          What?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          It's the Rex ...

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          They've stampeded ...


<b>BACK ON  THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE -
</b>
Grant and kids run for their lives.  Behind them the duckbills charge
with surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group,
kicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along.

CLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear.

A horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and
struggling to stay out from underfoot.

<b>CLOSE ON
</b> - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.

Frightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the
maelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust.

GRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind
Grant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust.

Another deafening ROAR of the T-Rex.

Grant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers.
The animals continue to close.

CLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground
VIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet.

GRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in
between big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her
dusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant
pushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks.

GRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another
slams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood.

Stampeding legs send clods of dirt fl
ying in the air.  Above, even the
birds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along.

GRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies
with giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle.

A boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his
rocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex.
They dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick
roots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING
the rocky enclave they have just left.

Grant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate
above them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move.
They watch the herd trample on.


CLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor.

Lex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth.

The T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur.

As the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges
fiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped 
in dust.

Grant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet
horror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Let's go.  Now!

The herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle.

Grant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction.


<b>BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -
</b>
Hammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly
clears.  Hadrosaurs scatter.

Now the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed
          one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          My animals!  My animals!

Muldoon enters, limping in.  Hammond is very upset.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Where have you been?  My Rex killed a
          hadrosaur.  You should be out there,
          doing something.

<b>                            MUL
</b><b>DOON
</b>          I just came to tell you - you're minus
          one computer expert.


<b>EXT  BY THE RIVER, PARK - DAY
</b>
The water rushes a few hundred yards away.  Grant and the kids have
finally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          We'll walk by the river.  That leads back
          to the Visitor's center.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Not me.  I'm not walking anymore.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Come on Lex, I'll carry you.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Nope.  Too scared.

Timmy looks up at Grant.  Grant kneels down by Lex.  Lex embraces Grant.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          You ready?

She wipes her tears.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't
          have to walk so close to the animals!

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          What raft?

Lex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is
twenty yards away.

<b>                            LEX
</b>
          Where I found Freda's baby.

Grant start to stand.  He's thinking.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at
          least ten miles to go.  If we take the
          raft along the river, we can make much
          faster progress.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Let's do it.


<b>INT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING -
</b>
Grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes
past drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of
cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators,
empty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Lex, I don't see any raft.

Timmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Keep going.

Grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe,
piles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Bullseye!

Timmy is reliev
ed.  Lex smiles.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Told you!

Grant grabs them.  Looks around, still -

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Actually, I never really saw one. Just
          assumed.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Assumed?

She nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking.

IN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of
light fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes
the handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall
on her, knocking her to the ground.

LEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off.

Grant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling
irrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!

Lex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.

<b>                            TIMM
</b><b>Y
</b>          Look, Lex!  Look!

She looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with
her.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          I'm afraid there's no raft.

Grant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it -
the box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles..


<b>AT THE RIVER'S EDGE -
</b>
Grant pulls a cord.

With a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking
and jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it
pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft.

Timmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and
pushes off with his oars.

The small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out
into the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks.

Grant surveys the river.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Looks pretty calm.

THUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard.
She reaches in
 about elbow deep.

Grant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his
might.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud
floor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water.

A general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream.


<b>A WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER -
</b>
Grant energetically works the oars.

CLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          I'll row, Dr. Grant.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          No.

But he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her
hand in the water.  It still trails.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Hey, we're still moving.

Grant looks into the water.  She's right.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          There's a current.

Grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two
kids look at him.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          You can't sleep.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>              (eyes closed)
          I'm not sl
eeping... yet.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          I'll do it!

Lex picks up the oars and begins.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          We gotta warn them about the boat.

Grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and
takes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current.


<b>A BEND IN THE RIVER -
</b>
Current picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Cool!

White foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out
laughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes.


<b>ANOTHER BEND -
</b>
Now the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is
rocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes
a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave.

The raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's
yanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his
grip again.  SHOUTS to Grant.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Thought
 is looked calm?

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Guess I was wrong.

Grant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly.

Lex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and
again.  Her face is serious.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          I can't swim!

Grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings.
He lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the
rubber grips.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Hold on real tight.

They go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens.

The raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way.

Jagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the
rocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging
trees.

Grant looks ahead.  He blanches.

HIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall.

They're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently,
heaving over the magnificent precipice.

Timmy tries to tighten L
ex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS:

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.

The raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around.

The rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out
of Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge.

At the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade.
With all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let
his hands smash into the overhanging branch.

They stop right at the waterfall's edge.

Grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps
rushing.  His strength ebbs.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Don't let go!

Grant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet
tree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip.

The rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft.
Lex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet.

<b>               
</b><b>             TIMMY
</b>          You can do it!

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....

His hands slipping, slipping ...

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          No!!!!!

<b>                                                      CUT TO:
</b>
CLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud.


<b>INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
Arnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.
          Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.

Hammond is above, in his throne.  He calls down:

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Could he drown in that position?  That's
          a very valuable animal.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          I know it's a valuable animal.

Muldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue
quietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.

<b>                            WU
</b>          What's that, John?

Wu points to the screen behind 
Arnold's head.  In the upper right-hand
corner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!  Ellie regards it.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          You running on auxiliary power?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          I'm not.

<b>                            WU
</b>          Looks like you are.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Can't be.

<b>                            WU
</b>          Print the system status log.

Arnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to
life.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off.

Ellie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR
FAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES.

Hammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up.

The room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes.
Hammond ROARS above the chaos.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          What the hell is going on?

Onscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches.
At zero, the lights go off, the monitors,
 even the computer.  Just the
alarms keep screaming.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          You're ruining my ordered, precise park!

Arnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward
Arnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!

Arnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's
attack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground.
Breathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest.

Arnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at
Hammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren:

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but
          I'm going to put it all back together for
          you - I promise.  I will


<b>BACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL -
</b>
Grant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from
toppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs.

The ROAR of the
 water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging
current to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle.
Nothing.

Grant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft,
the water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left
in the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them,
various pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered
by rushing white water.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          The waterfall stopped.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          I think they cut the power.  Hey -

He points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall
once poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist
is the visitor's center.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,
          kids.

They grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.


<b>BACK ON CON
</b><b>TROL ROOM -
</b>
Muldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is
alternate patches of bright and dark.

In a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow
with a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Told him, fix my park, fix my park.

Wu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological
rendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they
have been running on auxiliary power.  Wu yells above the alarm:

<b>                            WU
</b>          You shut down as six thirty-four this
          morning, and when you started back up, it
          was with auxiliary power.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up
          first and then that's used to start the
          main generator because it needs a heavy
          charge.  The main generator has to be
          manually reset.

<b>                            WU
</b>          Outside?  In
 the generator building?

Arnold nods.  Muldoon points to a line in the printout:

<b>06:35:22   WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB)  OPERATIVE - AUX POWER
</b>
<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          This doesn't mean the fences have been
          off since six-thirty, does it?

Arnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Backup power doesn't generate enough
          amperage to power the electrified fences,
          so they were automatically kept off.
          That's also why we had no phones or
          radio.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          All of the fences?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          Yes.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Including the velociraptor mesh?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>              (disgusted, exhausted)
          Yes, yes, yes.

In the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a
sitting position.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Do you mean those raptor
s could be loose?

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          I'm afraid so.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two
          days to chew through that mesh.  But give
          'em enough time, they'll get out.  We
          better get that power on now.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure
          there' five of them there.


<b>EXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - AFTERNOON
</b>
Muldoon and Arnold run across the lawn.  Muldoon carries his rocket
launcher at a ready position.  In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS,
lights FLASH a continued warning.

They reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed.  Its
familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms.  The closer they
approach, the louder and brighter these alarms are.  Grey steam pours
out of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.

<b>                            ARNOLD
</b>          What's that steam coming out of my
          generator room?

<b>           
</b><b>                 MULDOON
</b>          Relax, it's just refrigerated air.
          There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it
          a couple times before but the original
          installation was at too sharp an angle.

Arnold accepts this.  He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Just go and turn on your generator, then
          get right back to the control room.

Arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door.


<b>EXT  RAPTOR PIT - AFTERNOON
</b>
Muldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight.  The thick mesh that
covered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open.  With heavy gun
in one hand, Muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit.  It's empty.

Muldoon looks up.

MULDOON'S POV - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center.

Muldoon examines the ground.  He locates the raptor prints leading away

Muldoon breaks into a run.


<b>INT/EXT  GENERATOR ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
Muldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin
g full-tilt.  He
kicks open the door.  Steam pours out.  Standing in the thick steam,
Muldoon yells for Arnold.  No answer.  He steps in the doorway and
shines his flashlight around.

MULDOON'S POV - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes
and small machinery can be seen in the steam.

Muldoon yells again.  No answer at all.  Muldoon curses and leaves.

As soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement.  Even above the sirens,
an animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard.  Obscured by steam and
flashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow.  A pack of
cigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor.


<b>INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
Muldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu,

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Raptors chewed their way out.  All five
          are out there.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Arnold's not with you?

Muldoon looks around grimly.  He shakes his head.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          I was hoping he was ba
ck here already.

Hammond takes charge.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          This is why my quarters were specially
          fortified.  To assist in an emergency just
          like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round
          up the workers.  They'll go with us too.

Muldoon stares at Hammond, then drops it.  They prepare to go.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Wait.  What about Arnold?


<b>EXT  HILLSIDE, PARK -
</b>
Grant and the kids come over the hill.  Timmy sees the big fence and the
Visitor's Center close behind.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          We're home!

Lex and Grant happily run down the hill.


<b>EXT  ELECTRIFIED FENCE IN PARK - AFTERNOON
</b>
Grant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence.
This huge fence is much higher than what Timmy has had to climb.  Grant
turns to him apologetically.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up.

<b>                            TIM
</b>          That's all right, Dr. Grant.  You owe me
<b>   
</b>       one.


<b>EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - AFTERNOON
</b>
Wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding
Hammond's quarters..  Next to him is Ellie.  Behind both of them,
launcher at the ready, is Muldoon.  Watching from the window above,
Hammond waves.  Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every
          moment.  But this shell carries quite a
          punch, so if you're too close, it'll take
          a piece of you.  Ellie's on the headset
          with you.  If another ones come at you,
          let her know.  Then Ellie - you start
          jumping and yelling.  The buggers are
          easily distracted.  They'll come running
          and let Wu get that power on.  Then both
          of you, get behind this fence as quick as
          possible.

Wu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact.  We starts his way
across the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher.  Ellie stands
ready at the open 
gate.

Wu takes slow steps.  Muldoon follows.  Wu is just five feet away from
the door to the generator building.

CLOSE ON - Wu's tense face.

THE ATTACK is sudden and fierce.  It comes from the brush.  The raptor
leaps onto Wu in an instant.  Wu and the raptor roll on the ground.  Wu
struggles for his life.  Muldoon can't get a safe shot.  He SCREAM:

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.

Ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate.  She jumps up and
down, waving her hands, and SCREAMS:

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't
          catch me.  Hey, come and get me, you
          flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!

The Raptor is distracted by this.  He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking
him loose from his bloody jaws.  Instantly, Wu rolls away.  Muldoon
fires the rocket launcher.  With a SIZZLE, the missile fires.  BOOM!
Direct hit!  The raptor is blown to tiny pieces.

Muldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju
red man to safety.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          You ok?

In reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.

<b>                            WU
</b>          Now, there's four.

Muldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.  He waves for Ellie to come in
and join them.

Ellie takes off toward the generator building.  She YELLS:

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door
          after I go in.  Wu, guide me!

Muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may
be their best plan.

Ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and
graceful.  She ducks into the generator building.

Above it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window.


<b>BACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE
</b>
The three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex
above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to
begin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense
face is a river of sweat.


<b>INT  GE
</b><b>NERATOR BUILDING -
</b>
Ellie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall.
Her face is lit by a flashing yellow light.  She bangs her head on a
pipe.  She rubs her head.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Damn, I banged my head.

<b>                            WU (OVER RADIO)
</b>          Oh that's good, that must be the water
          pipe.  You're really close now, there's a
          cabinet just above your head.  Reach up
          and open it.  The handle turns to the
          left.

Ellie turns the handle.  The cabinet opens.

<b>                            WU (OVER RADIO)
</b>          It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down,
          count to three, and push it back up.
          That's all there is to it.

Ellie throws it down.  She counts:

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          One -


<b>BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -
</b>
Just a few feet from the bottom of the fence.


<b>BACK ON ELLIE -
</b>
<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Two -


<b>BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -
</b>
Grant and Timmy jump down. 
 Lex is just behind.  Her sneaker catches in
the fence pattern.  She pulls on it.


<b>BACK ON ELLIE -
</b>
<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Three!

She throws the large switch back.


<b>BACK ON LEX -
</b>
She jumps off the fence.  Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape.

Grant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe.
<b>NOTHING!  STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES!
</b>
The Visitor's Center is in sight.  They all turn to each other.  Elated.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          We did it!

<b>                            TIM
</b>          We made it!

Lex jumps up and down.  Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy.


<b>BACK ON ELLIE -
</b>
The siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie
turns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground.
She has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils.

It's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth.

SMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down
 from
above the water pipe Ellie banged her head on.

Ellie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it.
The raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall.

Ellie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push
against the wall, begins to climb up.

The raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie
scrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned.

Ellie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams
her feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and
banging against pipes, she races toward the door.


<b>EXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION
</b>
Ellie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters.
Wu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands
with his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie.
Ellie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Raptor!

The raptor EXPLODES th
rough the door of the generator building after
Ellie.

Muldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload.

The raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate.
He slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on.

Ellie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she
goes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges.

Muldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all
his might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a
second, it doesn't move.

Ellie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad
security door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a
curse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.

ELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of
the gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu.

<b>                            WU
</b>          Keep it open!  I'm coming!

Wu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.  Wu screams, runs spastically.
Wu and the raptor are neck-and-neck
, equally close to the open door.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run!

The raptor is inches from Wu.  Both are closer and closer to the door.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          They're coming inside!

<b>                            WU
</b>          Help!

Wu and the raptor are at the door.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          No they're not, Ellie.

Muldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor.  Wu's screams are
horrific.


<b>INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTION
</b>
Ellie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with
a bleeding hand.  Muldoon, affected, turns to her.

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          I couldn't compromise everyone's safety.

Ellie nods, catches her breath.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Why didn't the power go on?

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          You just reset the power.  Now the
          computer has to be booted.

Muldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do
or.

MULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu.  The gate to the
perimeter fence slides shut.  The raptor looks up.  He is trapped within
the perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters.

CAMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above.  Hammond stares down.


<b>INT  VISITOR'S CENTER -
</b>
Grant and kids walk through the open security doors.  All is empty and
quiet.  They call out but there are no answers.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Where did everybody go?

Grant thinks.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Probably your grandfather's quarters.
          Let's go.

A DISTANT BELLOW.  Grant reconsiders.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Actually, stay here.

He corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          No, I want to stay with you.

Grant looks around tensely.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          No, keep an eye on things round here for
          me.  I'll be back with the others.

<b>                 
</b><b>           TIMMY
</b>          What about -

Grant looks at Timmy.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          I'll radio the ship as soon as I find
          somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now.
          Don't move from here ... unless you have
          to, ok?

Timmy nods.  Lex is happy, sinks to the floor.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Goody!  I'm gonna rest.

She finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends it
walking to Timmy.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Tired!  He carried you the whole way.

Grant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of
the T-rex and raptor in combat.  He looks back above his own shoulder
into the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor.  He shouts back.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Be right back.


<b>INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -
</b>
It's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond.  Gennaro is
singing at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him.
Scared Workers huddle together, many a
re injured.  Hammond sits on the
floor, in a meditative trance.

Ellie and Muldoon stare out the window.

THEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air.  With every jump he comes
closer to leaping onto the roof of their small building.

Muldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Why don't you just nail that bastard?

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          No more ammo.  I requisitioned six
          charges but the bean-counter -
              (he thrusts a finger at Hammond)
          - cut it down to two.

Ellie looks up to the ceiling.  There is a large glass skylight with
crisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun.


<b>EXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - DAY
</b>
The ship continues along smooth sunlit sea.  Land is in distant sight.


<b>INT  STATEROOM -
</b>
The cracked egg is nudged open.  The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby
raptor nuzzles its way out of the shell.  It shakes off a few pieces of
clinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the
 remaining eggs.

<b>                                                      CUT TO:
</b>
CLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor.  It
bands against the  the wall again and again.

Timmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Any candy behind the counter?

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Hungry?

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Starved.

Timmy looks behind the counter.  He sees boxes of goods.  He moves a
stack of umbrellas out of his way.  Lex gets up and pulls one out.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Nothing.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Let's go to the kitchen.

She smiles and pops to her feet.  Timmy's not sure.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Dr. Grant said -

<b>                            LEX
</b>          - let's go.  We'll come right back.

CLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face.  He's hungry, too.

He makes the right decision.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Nope.  We're waiting here t
ill Dr. Grant
          gets back.  He'll help us get some -

Interrupted by A SOUND.  A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING.   Now some
light and rapid STEPS.  And a SNIFFING.  It's definitely an animal.

Lex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over.  It skirts
across the floor.  It spins and opens by itself.  Printed on it is the
ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills
spinning to a stop.

The breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a
corner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.

It's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it
studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes
flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.

Timmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off
across the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy
grabs another, whispers as he winds it.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Start winding now!

Lex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th
em across the hall.  The raptor
leaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges
and darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one.

The kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor
Center corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          Where are we going?

<b>                            TIM
</b>          The kitchen!


<b>INT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -
</b>
With a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's
quarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the
assembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS.

The raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the
skylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the
corners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          How long?

<b>                            MULDOON
</b>          Well, they seem to be getting faster all
          the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.

Ellie no
tices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the
gate.  She hammers on the glass.

Grant's hand reaches for the knob.

The raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up.

Ellie screams and screams.

Grant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks
up.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter.
Grant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the
fence, grabs it, puts it on.

Ellie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          There's a raptor on the roof of this
          building.  Open that gate and you're a
          dead man.

Grant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand
to the glass.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Ellie, I'm go glad -

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          Shut up and listen.  We have about
          fifteen minutes here.  The computer has
          to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the
          electric fences.  Besides the r
aptor
          stuck in here with us, there are four
          more ...

Grant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in.


<b>INT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION
</b>
The kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a
maze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless
steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids
dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,
crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.

Relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids
their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their
shortcuts, it just continues around.

Timmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to
hurry inside.  Timmy grabs her.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          We'll freeze to death in there.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          He's going to eat us!

Timmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile 
of steaks.  He tosses one
toward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex
out of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the
other, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer.

The raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He
continues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait.

Tim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and
throws her small weight alongside of Timmy's.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b><b>          PUSH!
</b>
The heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a
strangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of
the door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve
but they do not give.

The kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment,
Timmy is back on his feet.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          What is it, Timmy?

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          I just remembered something.  Rapto
rs are
          born in large litters.  There's probably
          more coming.  We gotta hide.

He grabs her hand and they run out of the back entrance of the kitchen.
There's a stairway and they race up.


<b>INT  GIFT SHOP -
</b>
Grant, wearing his headset, calls for the kids and looks around the gift
shop with concern.  He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup
toys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above
and begins to run.


<b>INT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER -
</b>
The kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into -


<b>INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY -
</b>
The kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room.


<b>INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY -
</b>
Automated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment
to the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground.


<b>INT  GENETICS ROOM -
</b>
The Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and
magnetic tape as the kids race by.


<b>INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY -
</b>
The kids slide int
o this room.  They race to its far corner, past
incubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -

KID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's
been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.

CLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.

He begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.

The raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his
younger sister.

CLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.

At the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the
situation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one
of the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He
comes out with a syringe and a vial.

The raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The
raptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.

Grant speaks into the headset.

<b>                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
</b>          Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.

He tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The
raptor studies it, transfixed.

Grant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor
forgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it
up, swallowing it whole.

The raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,
tenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.

The kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset
as the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Timmy, you know anything about computers?

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told
          my Dad I wanted a 386.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Ok good, you're elected.


<b>INT  CONTROL ROOM -
</b>
Grant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room.  Grant speaks calmly into
his headset.

<b>                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
</b>          Okay, we've reached the computer room.
          Who can te

<b>                            ELLIE (OVER RADIO)
</b>          Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot
          the computer.  Please hurry, we've only
          got a couple minutes left.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Tim, you got to book the system.  They
          reset the power and there are no phones.
          We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta
          stop that ship.

<b>                            LEX

<b>                            GRANT

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking.

He studies a grid on a large console.  He reaches out and touches a part
of the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT.
<b>PLEASE TRY AGAIN.
</b>

<b>BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -
</b>
The raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.  Panic below.
In the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset.


<b>BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -
</b>
Timmy tries somethin
g else.  BEEP.  Lex raises a hand.  Grant stops her.

<b>                            GRANT (TO RADIO)
</b>          Ellie, we're working as fast as we can
          here.

Timmy tries a screen section.  BEEP.  Again. BEEP.  Again.  BEEP.  BEEP.

Timmy shakes his head.  In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below
the touch screen.  He punches the ESCAPE button.

The screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL
<b>SYSTEMS NORMAL.
</b>

<b>BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -
</b>
The raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space
as the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as
the current flows through him.  He can't get out.

Finally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the
space he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below.

Ellie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock.


<b>BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -
</b>
Grant cheers and hugs Timmy.  Lex whoops.

<b>                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
</b>          Ok, we're all right here for now.

<b>                            GRANT (TO RADIO)

<b>                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)
</b>          But there's still one more raptor.  So be
          careful.

Timmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now.
COMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ...  He gets the one he wants.

He indicates the radio-mike to Grant.

<b>                            TIM
</b>          I think this is the boat.  They called it
          the Queen Anne or something.

Grant grabs the mike.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne?

The radio crackles to life.

<b>                            RADIO
</b>          This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy.
          What's up?

Tim punches the screen which displays FARRELL, F

A blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from
the harbor.  Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact.

<b>                            TIMMY
</b>          What's the Uniform Maritime Code?

<b>

Grant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts.

<b>                            LEX
</b>          What good does that do?  To have the ship
          turn around?

Grant turns to her seriously.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Well it gives us ten more hours.
              (to Timmy)
          Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican
          Coast Guard on that thing.

The last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing
window.  Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway.


<b>INT ROTUNDA -
</b>
With the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and
Lex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant
goes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time.

The raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the
display.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and
tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat
behind, and his snar
ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.

The kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating
rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,
closing the gap on the kids.

The kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the
skeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor
is pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes.

Grant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it,
and slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive
head of the T-Rex drops free.

It falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>              (grimly)
          And then there were none.


<b>EXT  HELICOPTER PAD - DUSK
</b>
Muldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter.  Two workers carry
Gennaro on a stretcher.  Ellie boards with the kids on each side of her,
holding her hands.

Grant and Hammond walk together, toward the helicopter.

<b>              
</b><b>              HAMMOND
</b>          Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful

<b>                            GRANT

Hammond stops.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful
          plans in the works, sites already
          purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic
          Japan.

Grant is unimpressed.  He holds a hand out to Hammond.  Hammond tries a
new approach.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          Don't you see I've exalted human

          Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part
          of this.  I'm inviting you to do just

<b>                            HAMMOND

          spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire
          solar system in interlocking motion.  Our
          own beings in biological step with it
          all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the
          pattern and look what it's done!

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          I know what it's done.  I've made
          triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex.
          I've got a batch of iguanadons being born
          on Tuesday.  What do you say to that?

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Don't count on it.  Now get in.

Grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          You created mutant forms that you further
          mutated to create amus
ement attractions.
          You made biological puppets with
          heartbeats and an early death sentence.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          I created genetic miracles!

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          You created a park to generate a profit-
          making merchandising operation.

<b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          The merchandise is just a by-product.
          Souvenirs for people to reflect on the
          wonder.  You fainted when you saw the
          brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not
          argue.  The problem is that my employees
          were not up to par with my dream.  They
          failed me.  The park, I promise you, is
          safe.  It really is.

Grant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          You park is doomed.  Now come with me.
<b>          
</b><b>                            HAMMOND
</b>          It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes
          of labor!  You are one more more negative
          voice in a 
universe of negativity.
          You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a
          bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you.

Hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as
the ROTORS START UP.  Hammond's suit whips in the wind.  Grant calls to
him, reaching out his arm.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over!

Hammond keeps walking.  He disappears over a grassy knoll.

Grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when THE ATTACK comes.

With a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter.  THE
PILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off.

The Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape.  The
copter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on.

Ellie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its
jaws relax.  The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky.
The Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter
a final swipe with its tail.

The tail SWISHES through 
the air and CRACKS against the plexiglass
windshield which fissures and pops.  The pilot struggles to maintain
altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air.

With a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars.
away, leaving an angry T-Rex alone.  Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex,
Hammond slips away and walks into the jungle.


<b>IN THE COPTER -
</b>
SLOWLY PAN the exhausted faces of Muldoon and his workers, Lex and Timmy
holding onto each other, and Grant huddles next to Ellie.  He reaches
out and puts an arm around her shoulder.  She reaches up and pulls his
arm close.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          They're so beautiful.  They're condemned,
          aren't they?  Even those embryo fragments
          had the same viral contamination.

<b>                            GRANT
</b>          I have a theory.

Ellie looks up in surprise.  She give him a big smile.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          You have a theory?

Grant smiles back at her.

<b>                            GRANT
</b><b>   
</b>       I think that they could never completely          
          isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was
          always some microscopic mosquito
          contamination.  But at the molecular
          level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur
          received the same genetic massage, the
          encoding that every mosquito gets to
          terminate life after a season.

<b>                            ELLIE
</b>          So the very process itself was flawed.

She's sad.  Grant hugs her.  Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance
to the island.  A green jewel in a blue sea.  Suddenly it is obliterated
by clouds.

CAMERA PANS AWAY AND SWOOPS DOWN from the copter.  IT CROSSES the sky.
THE CAMERA DESCENDS to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural
beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle.


<b>IN THE JUNGLE - MAGIC HOUR
</b>
Hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth.  He
almost reaches the top when he slips.  He falls to the soft ground and
rolls. He tumbles he
lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop,
finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water.  Face
down, his head splashes into the puddle.  No movement. Just the sound of
labored breath.

CAMERA PANS to Hammond's hand, half-submerged in water.  CAMERA MOVES
INTO EXTREME CLOSEUP as a mosquito lands on his hand.

<b>                                         RACK OUT AND DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

<b>EXT  OCEAN - NIGHT
</b>
The army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne B,
slowly drifting across the moonlit water.

<b>                                                      FADE OUT.
