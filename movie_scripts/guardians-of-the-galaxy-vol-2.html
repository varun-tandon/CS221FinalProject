          OVERHEAD SHOT: A `79 Cobra winds alongside the Missouri
          River, past swaying loosestrife, vibrant sugar maples, and
          oily self-pump gas stations. A hazy sun glints off the hood

          Meredith LAUGHS too. She SINGS and dances with abandon in

          We PAN and see the speakers and Walkman beside him, and we
          realize Baby Groot has traveled around the entire Power

          IN SLOW-MOTION, Quill, Drax, and Gamora approach the oval

          across the way at a SLEEP CHAMBER, where Mantis helps Ego lie
          down on a slab.

          A HUNDRED DARTS FLY AT THE GROUP from traps set in trees.

          He stops in a tree at the end of the run.   He holds a device

          A PERCUSSIVE BOMB at the feet of the Ravagers BURSTS, sending

          the second button and a second BOMB BURSTS. They FLY UP INTO

          Rocket SNICKERS, as he continues pushes the buttons and the

          with the landing pad itself.

                    Gamora and me battle one another in
                    `training.' Every time my sister
                    prevailed my father would replace a
                    piece of me with machinery,
                    claiming he wanted me to be her
                    equal. But she won, again and again
                    and again. Never once refraining.
                    Because of them, I am this. So

                    conceivable instrument of death.

          Gamora FLEES from Nebula's ship like Cary Grant from the crop
          duster in North by Northwest as HUGE CHUNKS OF LAND EXPLODE
          on either side of her.
                         
          Gamora leaps into a DITCH, LANDING HARD, as the M-Ship SWOOPS
          just a couple feet above her.

          Gamora sees the M-Ship banking and FLYING BACK at her again.
                         
          She stands and runs along the hillside as GUN BLASTS burst
          behind her. But Gamora sees a CAVERN, leading down into the
          earth.

          As Gamora RUNS down the cavern, she glances back over her
          shoulder where Nebula, insane with rage, continues FLYING
          towards her --
                         
          The M-SHIP ENTERS THE CAVERN, which is too small for it,
          CLIPPING ITS WINGS - but it keeps flying. It again BLASTS at
          Gamora as she FLEES -
                         
          The BLASTS cause the ground to COLLAPSE around Gamora, and
          she FALLS, SMASHING DOWN THROUGH ONE LEVEL, to another level
          below, SLAMMING HARD on the ground.
                         
          The underside of the M-ship gets SCRAPED APART as it flies
          above her, and pieces of it come RAINING DOWN around her.
                         
          Nebula ZOOMS towards a huge cavern wall.   She tries to turn
          her ship in time, to no avail.
                         
          She SIDESWIPES it, falling down, CRASHING on the ground,
          where she is now on the same level as Gamora.
                         
          Gamora sees something beside her: it's one of the ENORMOUS
          BLASTERS from the M-ship, attached to an AMMO RIG.

          blaster, and clutching it. It is comically enormous.
                         
          Nebula struggles to get free and out of the way, but her legs

          GUN, as she walks forward.
                         
          The front of the M-ship is peppered with blasts and then
<b>          EXPLODES.
</b>                         
          The explosion causes the thin ground around it to COLLAPSE,
          and the entire ship FALLS BACKWARDS to an even LOWER LEVEL -
          BURSTING some more as it hits the ground.
                         
          Gamora gazes down at the ship.

          SPARKING and she can hardly breathe. It seems as she's going
          to die, when --
                         
          Part of the ship is TORN AWAY.    She sees Gamora.
                         
          Gamora GRABS HER, unceremoniously PULLING HER FREE, just as
          the M-ship EXPLODES, PITCHING THEM BOTH to the ground.
                         
          They lie next to each other. Nebula COUGHS as her legs are
          healing, CRACKING back into place.
                         
          She looks over and eyes Gamora.

          Nebula snatches Gamora's blade from her, and TUMBLES on top
          of her as she gains the upper hand. She holds the blade
          above Gamora, ready to plummet it into her.
