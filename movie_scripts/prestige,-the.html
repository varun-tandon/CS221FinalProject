          A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Bearded Man from the aisle. He

          This is ROBERT ANGIER, 35, an American. Looming over him is
          a large and complex ELETRICAL MACHINE.

          Bearded Man pulls off his beard, revealing the face of ALFRED

          The Stagehand raises his eyebrows and steps aside. Borden
          RACES down below the stage. Cutter approaches the Stagehand.

          Borden fumbles through the darkned area, lit by flashes and
          sparks through gaps in the boards of the stage above. He
          GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE

          Borden lights a MATCH. In front of him is a LARGE GLASS

          FLINCHES. Then STARES, FASCINATED.

          Bolts of electicity draw inwards, wrapping Angier in a ball
          of light which CRACKS-

                         

<b>           CUTTER (V.O.)

<b>           CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          The MACHINE sputters to a stop. Angier is GONE. The audience
          sits, WAITING.

          Cutter looks across at Borden, who is absently tapping his

          waves back, then is GUIDED OUT by a man wearing GLOVES and
          BOWLER HAT- this is FALLON. He nods at Borden.

          OWENS, 50's a lawyer, stands at the entry gate. The CAPTAIN
          of the guard walks out to greet him.

                         

<b>                          CAPTAIN

          Owens raises his eyebrows.

</b>           Not my idea, sir. The Warden saw
           his show in Manchester last year
           where he vanished into thin air-
           he's convinced he'll try an escape.

                         
          Owens smiles as he hands over his pocket watch ans wallet.
          They walk along a hall wrought iron fence. The PRISON looms
          over them.
          A door in the prison opens and Borden emerges, trussed
          absurdly in chains held by two WARDERS. The other INMATES
          begin cattle-calling and whistling as BOrden is paraded up
          to a WOODEN SECTION of the fence.

           out with the others immates.

                         
          At the fence, the Warders lock the ends of their chains to a
          thick eye hook set into the ground.

          They check the locks. Then retreat to allow privacy. The
          Captain marches away. Borden looks at Owens. Bored.

          heavily on his cane limps over to the light and stares up at

          STEEL BALL. GIANT ARCING BOLTS of electricity run down the

          he sneaks a light KISS on her ankle. She frowns at him and
          raises her arms. Milton hooks the rope onto the chain.

          A grand GESTURE from Milton- the curtain around the tank
          DROPS- Julia is GONE. Milton raises the curtain again, then
          with another flourish, DROPS it to reveal JULIA, beside the
          tank, one arm in the air, dripping wet, smiling.

          shawl, and SNAPS it away- the flower has become the CANARY.
          The audience bursts into enthusiastic APPLAUSE, but the little
          boy is still CRYING INCONSOLABLY. Virgil takes bows and
          walks off, handing Borden the canary as he passes backstage.
          As the audience leaves, Borden climbs off the stage and hols
          the bird in front of the boy.

          Borden walks to a wall of DOZENS of bird cages -- each one
          with an identical canary. He puts the bird into its cage
          and returns to the cart props. He taps on the top of the
          TABLE- a panel POPS open, revealing the FLATTENDED BIRD CAGE.
          Borden insefts a ROD into the bird cage and PRIES it apart.
          A TRICKLE of BLOOD emerges, dripping into a bucket below.

          SCANS the crowd. Finally SPOTS Fallon pushing to the front-
          he is alone. Borden stares at him. Fallon shakes his dead.

                         
          Borden is prompted to stand by two GUARDS as the Judge enters.
          The JUDGE has a piece of black cloth draped over his wig.

           guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.
           You will, in one month's time, be
           hanged by the neck until dead. May
           the Lord have mercy on your soul.

          The storm has abated. Angier's cane into the muddy ground
          as he follows Alley through the moonlit field.

                         
          There are large glass GLOBES pushing out of the soil as if
          planted all around them. They stop in the middle of the

          LIGHTBULBS, all glowing together. Alley bends down and picks
          up the nearest lightbulb -- as he does, the light in it
          extinguises. He tosses the bulb to Angier. Except for the
          size, it's a normal lightbulb.

          Angier is sitting at a worktable, pensive. He is moving one

          On the other side of the room Cutter watches as OLIVIA
          WENSCOMBE, 20s, equal parts grace and mischief, squeezes
          herself into a tall cabinet, looking past Cutter to Angier.

<b>           ANGIER (V.O.)
</b>           It was the greatest magic trick I
           have ever seen.
          Borden walks to one side of the stage and OPENS the door to
          one of the cabinets. It's empty. He CLOSES it again and
          crosses the stage, BOUNCING the ball the whole way.
          At the far cabinet, Borden repeats the process, OPENING the
          door to the empty cabinet. This time, however, he leaves
          the door open.
          He steps forwards and GENTLY BOUNCES the ball SIDEWAYS, across
          the stage...
          Borden STEPS into the CABINET behind him, CLOSING the door.
          With no one on stage, the audience watches as the ball
          continues to BOUNCE across the stage. BOUNCE. BOUNCE.
          BOUNCE. The ball loses seep and height...
          Just as reaches the second cabinet, something IMPOSSIBLE
          happens.

          Angier is onstage, nearing the end of his show, SMILING
          BROADLY as he pulls dozens of FLOWERS from thin air and tosses
          them to the crowd. APPLAUSE fills the theatre.

                         
          The DOORFRAMES are wheeld out on either side of the stage.
          Angier approaches the edge of the stage to address the
          audience with a suddenly SOLEMN demeanor.

<b>                          ANGIER
</b>           Ladies and gentlemen, much of what
           you've seen tonight can be termed
           illusions. Entertaining trifles of
           the sort you may have seen other
           magicians perform.

                         
          Angier puts on a TOP HAT.

                         

<b>                          ANGIER (CONT'D)
</b>           Alas, I cannot claim this next feat
           as illusion. Watch carefully- you
           will see no trickery, for no trickery
           is being employed. Merely a techique
           familiar to certain citizens of the
           orient and various holy men of the
           Himalyas. Indeed, some of you may
           be familiar with this technique, but
           for those of you who aren't, do not
           be alarmed, what you are about to
           see is considered safe...

                         
          Angier gracefully TURNS and heads upstage to the right-hand
          door, opens it, SLAPS it to show that is sold.

                         
          Then strolls through crossing the stage-

                         
          -to the other door, which he opens, SLAPPING to show its
          solidity, then walking trough the frame.

                         
          Angier removes his TOP HAT and THROWS it high into the air.
          It sails back down to him and he catches it.

                         
          Angier THROWS the HAT again, even harder this time, and it
          disappears uo into the rafters. After a beat, it is clear
          it's not coming back down.

                         
          LAUGHTER. Angier snaps his fingers and the hat is dropped
          back down to him. He catches it.

                         
          Angier movies to the first door and THROWS HIS HAT in a HIGH
          ARC across the stage. He OPENS the door- steps behind it...

                         
          The second DOOR, FAR ACROSS THE STAGE, IMMEDIATELY opens and

<b>          ANGIER/ROOT EMERGES, REACHING UP TO CATCH THE HAT.
</b>
                         
          BOTH DOORS SLAMS SHUT behind him. He puts on the hat.

                         
          The AUDIENCE ERUPTS- A STANDING OVATION, Fallon the only one
          in his seat as Angier/Root takes his BOWS.

                         

<b>          INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS
</b>

                         
          Angier, hearing the MASSIVE APPLAUSE, climbs off the straw
          mattress, PEERING up through the cracks in the floorboards.

                         
          Smiling, Angier turns to the unseen audience and BOWS.

<b>          INT. DRESSING ROOM -- EVENING
</b>
          Angier, Olivia, and Cutter are CELEBRATING their sucess.
          Empty bottles of champagne line the makeup table.

<b>                          OLIVIA

<b>                          CUTTER
</b>           The manager said he's never seen a
           reaction like it.
          Angier smiles, rueful.

<b>                          ANGIER
</b>           At least he got to see it. I spent
           the ovation hidden under the stage.
           No one cares about the man who
           disappears, the man who goes into
           the box. They care about the man
           who comes out the other side.

<b>                          OLIVIA
</b>           I care about the man in the box.
          Angier turns to Olivia, raises his glass.

<b>                          ANGIER
</b>           Thank you.

<b>                          (TO CUTTER)
</b>           Maybe we could switch before the
           trick. That way I could be the
           Prestige and Root ends up below stage.

<b>                          CUTTER
</b>
<b>                          (SHAKES HEAD)
</b>           The antecipation of the trick is
           everything- it needs your showmanship
           to built suspense. If Root opens
           his mouth, it's all over- he can't
           introduce the trick.

<b>           ROOT (O.S.)
</b>           of course I can. I'm the Great
           Danton.
          They turn. Root is lying behind a trunk, still in costume.

<b>                          CUTTER
</b>           Root, you bloody fool, get that
           costume and makeup off right now,
           anyone could walk in here!

                         
          Cutter is SLAPPING Root to his feet. He grabs his collar
          and turns to Angier and Olivia.

</b>           Congratulation, all.

                         
          Cutter DRAGS Root out. Olivia slides onto the makeup table.

                         

<b>                          ANGIER
</b>           I suppose I should get more rest.

                         

<b>                          OLIVIA
</b>           Life is not full of these moments,
           Robbie.

                         
          Olivia pours him some more champagne.

          Angier looks up at her with a gentle smile. She pulls him
          in closer and they KISS. She wraps her legs around him.
          They kiss again.

                         
          Angier pulls back.

                         

<b>                          OLIVIA (CONT'D)

</b>           It is your wife?

                         
          Angier shakes his head, distracted.

                         

<b>                          ANGIER

          Olivia stares at him.

<b>                          ANGIER
</b>           It's not as good as his trick.

                         

<b>                          OLIVIA
</b>           Borden's trick is nothing compared
           to ours. He doesn't have any style-

           hiding under the stage.

                         
          Angier rises, turning out of her embrace.

<b>           64.

<b>                          ANGIER
</b>           So that I can do it better.
          Angier turns to her. Looks her in the eye.

<b>                          ANGIER (CONT'D)

          Angier moves to Olivia, placing his hands on her shoulders.

</b>           Think of it, Olivia... we've got

          Alley shows Angier in. Tesla is sitting, reading.

           much money had bought you, Mr. Angier.

                         
          Tesla RISES. Leads Angier to a back corner at the room and
          pulls a SHEET from a ten-foot tall apparatus- the ELECTRICAL
          MACHINE Angier used on stage in the opening of the film.

          Alley FIRES a GENERATOR connected by thick cables to the
          machine. It RUMBLES into life, smoke pouring from the slats.

          Angier takes off his hat and tries to hand it to Tesla.
          Alley intercepts the hat and lays it on a chalk hasmark
          directly underneath the machine. He returns to the controls.

                         

<b>                          ALLEY

          Without further ceremony, Alley FIRES the machine.

                         
          Nothing happens. Then, as they watch, the GLOBE on top of
          the tripped FLASHES whits hot. BOLTS shooting out of it,
          wrapping themselves around the legs of the tripod. The CHARGE
          reaches a FREEZY and then emits a loud BANG, as if it has
          broken the sound barrier.

                         
          Suddenly the room is still.

                         
          Tesla walks forward. Looks down into the pit.

                         
          Alley joins him at the edge of the pit. Angier, limping,
          is the last to arrive, locking into the pit-

                         
          -at the TOP HAT, which hasn't moved an inch.

          As he reaches the other side, Borden is gone, but he sees
          Angier dissappear down and alleyway.

          Angier stands at the other end of the hallway, watching him.

                         
          Fallon takes a step towards him and CRASHES through the rotten

          DISORIENTED, Fallon just glimpses CUTTER DROP THE LID INTO

          A GUNSHOT TEARS through the lid of the box. Cutter falls
          back, but is caught by Angier.

                         
          Angier rolls Cutter off to one side. He is clutching at a

          to follow the noise.

                         
          He stops at the opening of a tiny GLADE, no more than ten

          Two IDENTICAL CATS are fighting viciously in front of Angier.
          He tries to separate the two animals, and succeeds in grabbing
          one. The other cat RACES off.

          its way through them.

          Borden wanders into a tunel. Another man is waiting for

</b>          A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Borden from the aisle. He
          shuffles along his row towards her. Embarrassed.
          Borden and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant down
          towards the stage...
          On which stands Angier, leaning on his cane, smiling. Looming
          over him is the large and complex ELECTRICAL MACHINE. Borden
          STARES at the machine as he mounts the stage.
          Borden, FASCINATED, and the other volunteers look over the
          vast machine. As Angier GESTURES theatrically at the various
          features of the metal and glass apparatus.

                         
          As the Assistant leads the Volunteers to the side of the

          GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE

          It's sealed shut. He leaves the tank and begins searching
          around under the stage. He finds a SPANNER.

                         
          Borden SMASHES again and again at the glass of the tank,
          which spiders, then CRACKS, and finally GIVES WAY.

                         
          WATER bursts from the tank, sweeping Angier's body into
          Borden, and both of them onto gournd.
          Above them we can hear YELLING. Borden rolls Angier onto

          Borden turns slowly to look back into the cellar, PEERING
          into the flickering light of the burning lamp oil.

          Borden stares back into the cellar. What he sees puts a
          look on his face that is beyond words:

          Cutter spreads MORTAT on the last BRICK of the wall he has
          built in the opening to the cellar.

                         
          He places the brick in the wall, sealing it up.

          A cat slinks its way through a pile of top harts, knocking
          one over as it disappears into the forest beyond.
