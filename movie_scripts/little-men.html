<b>1   INT. UPPER WEST SIDE SCHOOL/CLASSROOM - DAY                   1
</b>
    Loud conversation, laughter, singing, and even dancing: the
    teacher is missing in a 7th Grade classroom. This rare
    absence of authority is intensely enjoyed by the crowd. It
    looks like it's party time for these KIDS.

    They talk and laugh, show each other photos on their phones,
    draw spaceships and baboons on their notebooks, and fold
    pieces of paper into airplanes that fly around the room.

    In a corner, a GROUP OF GIRLS dance to the tune of a song
    they are listening to on headphones.

    On the other side of the room, TWO BOYS play like in a sword
    fight, without swords.

    Suddenly, someone turns out the lights. There's random
    shouting and laughter.

    An overhead projector is turned on, and a couple of the kids
    start to make puppet figures that are seen on the white
    screen.

    A door opens, and a voice is heard, grave and authoritative.

<b>                        MR. PLUMMER (O.S.)
</b>              What is going on here?!

    The kids scramble back to their seats as the lights go on.
    MR. PLUMMER, the teacher, has come in.

<b>                        MR. PLUMMER
</b>              What is this mess?? Didn't you
              promise me to be quiet? Can't I
              even leave you alone for five
              minutes?? Lionel, sit down. Sit
              down, I said! Melissa, put your
              phone away. Put it away right now!
              I asked you to be quiet, and...
              look at you. What a disappointment.

    Mr. Plummer wanders around the classroom, inspecting
    everyone. Each kid has a different reaction. Some are
    frightened, others think it's funny. Some are respectful, and
    some others, defiant.

    The teacher stops by a desk that's covered by a VERY COLORFUL
    DRAWING, while the STUDENT rushes to put away his large
    collection of Caran d'Ache pencils neatly in the box.

<b>                        MR. PLUMMER (CONT'D)
</b>              Jacob, what is this?
                  Shooting Script 07/27/15               2.


JACOB "JAKE" JARDINE is pale and slender, with straight black
hair, a bit longer than the other kids, and deep brown eyes -
pretty in a delicate way, and shy, different from the other
tougher boys in the class.

<b>                    JAKE
</b>          It's the sky, Mr. Plummer.

Mr. Plummer picks up his drawing and shows it to the class.

<b>                    MR. PLUMMER
</b>          A green sky with yellow stars??

<b>                    JAKE
</b>              (barely audible)
          It's Camp Jupiter's sky.

<b>                    MR. PLUMMER
</b>          Watch out, Jacob: Vincent van Gogh
          ended up cutting off his own ear.

Some of the boys have a ball with this. Girls cover their
mouths not to laugh out loud. Jake blushes, his eyes fill up
with quiet, angry tears; he wasn't even talking to anyone,
he was just drawing, doing his thing. Life is so unfair.

<b>                    MR. PLUMMER
</b>          Quiet!! I said quiet, everybody!
          This is not a playroom. It's not an
          art studio. Much less a disco, Ms.
          Neves. It's a classroom. It is my
          classroom, and I asked you to be
          quiet. A simple request, and you
          showed me you don't know how to
          behave yourselves. Was I talking to
          the walls? Amanda, please collect
          everybody's homework, and bring
          them to me.

AMANDA, the teacher's favorite, promptly goes around the
class collecting homework. The individual students now listen
intently to Mr. Plummer's speech. But there are exceptions;
one or two still defy his authority, swallowing a laughter
that cannot contain itself.

<b>                    MR. PLUMMER (O.S.)
</b>          If I had to leave the class, it is
          because I had something very
          important to do. I come back, and I
          see you screaming and dancing!
          There's a saying, it's an old
          saying, that says: "Silence is
          golden." Write this down, children.

              see. Talking is cheap, people
              follow like sheep."

    Mr. Plummer writes this up on the board. Jake, instead of
    writing, furiously draws a wild dancing cobra on his
    notebook.

<b>                        MR. PLUMMER
</b>              What does this mean?

    Amanda raises her hand, ready to give an answer.

<b>                        MR. PLUMMER
</b>              Not now, Amanda. I want you all to
              write down your thoughts on this:
              "silence is golden."

    He underlines "silence is golden" on the board.

<b>                        MR. PLUMMER (CONT'D)
</b>              Every child is to write an essay on
              its meaning. Two pages minimum.
              That's your homework for tomorrow.
              Don't even come to the class if you
              haven't done it! Now, let's open
              our books. Page 23. Lionel, start
              reading from the top. Stand up,
              please. Stand up so we can all hear
              you.


<b>2   EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE SCHOOL - DAY                                2
</b>
    Large groups of KIDS are coming out through the main gate of
    the school. PILAR, a Filipino woman in her 50's, waits
    outside looking attentively at every kid who walks out. She
    sees the one she's looking for.

    In the middle of different groups and cliques, Jake comes
    walking alone.

<b>                        PILAR
</b>              Jake! Jake! Hey, Jake! Here!

    Jake sees her, then runs and gives her a big hug, longer than
    expected.

<b>                        PILAR
</b>              Hey hey hey. Look at you.

    She ruffles his hair lovingly.

               home very late tonight. Come on.
               Let's go.

     They begin to walk together away from the school.

</b>               I'm thirsty.

</b>
     Jake and Pilar are walking. Jake now has a drink from Papaya
     King in his hand.

<b>                         PILAR
</b>               Listen, Jake. It's your
               grandfather Max. There have been
               some... developments.

               you when they get home. But I'm
               going to make dinner for you. What
               do you want?

     He thinks for a moment.

               What happened to Grandpa Max?

               We need to get to the grocery.

     They cross the street and continue on.

     A comfortable, but cramped, NYC apartment.

     In the kitchen, Pilar is preparing a steaming pot of
     caldereta, Filipino beef stew.

     A phone starts ringing, and Jake storms out of his bedroom.

<b>                         PILAR
</b>               Hey! Did you finish your homework?

grandfather has died.

<b>4   EXT. JARDINE HOUSE/CASA DE MODA - DAY                         4
</b>
    LEONOR CALVELLI rolls down the metal shutters of a Brooklyn
    storefront. A sign above reads "CASA DE MODA". It's the
    ground floor commercial space of a two-story row house on a
    commercial street in Brooklyn. She pushes down the last bit
    of the gate with her foot to lock it up. You can still go in
    and out through a door space that's open. She lights up a
    cigarette and leans on the gate, calmly surveying the street -
    a daily routine.

    Leonor is in her early 50's, dark hair and dark eyes, her
    beauty toughened up by a hard life. After a few puffs, she
    hears a car parking in front, doors open and close. Leonor
    recognizes someone, and throws her cigarette out. She opens
    the door, and calls inside the store.

<b>                        LEONOR
</b>              Antonio! Antonio!

</b>              Come! Come here!*

    *- Throughout the film, italics will indicate when Leonor,
    Tony and others speak Spanish.

    She forces a smile, greeting the still unknown visitor, then
    she turns to inside and calls again, impatiently.

<b>5   EXT. JARDINE HOUSE/CASA DE MODA - DAY                         5

    Across the street from Leonor, Jake is helping his parents
    BRIAN and KATHY JARDINE get plates of food wrapped in
    cellophane and other catering goods from out of the car. The
    couple, dressed in formal dark clothes, have the youthful
    look of people who can afford to take a nice vacation once a
    year.

    Jake sees when ANTONIO "TONY" CALVELLI, a handsome 13 year
    old boy with dark hair and eyes, comes running out from
    inside the store, and stops next to Leonor.

<b>                    LEONOR
</b>          What were you doing?? If I say
          `come here', you have to come. Give
          them a hand. Go.

But Tony doesn't move, unsure of what to do. He looks at
Jake, who is looking at him.

Brian drops a plate in Jake's hands and goes towards Leonor,
with an extended hand.

<b>                     BRIAN
</b>          Hello Mrs. Calvelli. Brian Jardine,
          we've met.

<b>                    LEONOR
</b>          Of course, Brian. I'm so sad for
          what has happened. I'm so sorry.

Jake sees when Leonor, suddenly overtaken by emotion, grabs
his father's hand and pulls him closer for a hug, which makes
Brian visibly uncomfortable. Leonor tries to hide her tears.

<b>                    LEONOR
</b>          I'm sorry. Your father was a such a
          wonderful man.

Kathy approaches, carrying a plate of food.

</b>          I don't think you've met my wife
          Kathy.

<b>                    LEONOR
</b>          Hi. Nice to meet you. Leonor.

Kathy smiles warmly, as Brian opens the door to the house.

<b>                    KATHY
</b>          So nice to meet you too. Sorry, my
          hands are full.

<b>                       LEONOR
</b>          Of course.

Brian and Kathy go upstairs with their bags.

Left alone by the car, Jake tries to grab a sketchbook from
inside as he balances the big plate of food with his other
hand and then, a bit clumsy, ends up dropping the bag.

Tony is suddenly there to help him out. He kneels down to
pick up pages with drawings, pencils and stuff spilling out
of the bag, immediately recognizing the first drawing he sees
- a girl with red wings flying through a thundercloud.

<b>                    JAKE
</b>          Here, pass me that. I can carry it.

In the distance, Leonor watches, while Tony helps by pulling
another set of plates and bottles out of the car, organizing
a crate to be carried off.

<b>                    TONY
</b>          Tyson is such a douchebag.

    The apartment is old and in desperate need of a paint job.
    It's a large space, crammed with the stuff of a long life.
    There are family photos, piles of National Geographic

    A small, vintage color TV sits alone in the corner.

    There's a quiet reception going on, with most people wearing
    black, or dark colors, and talking softly to each other.
    Amongst the mostly older friends and relatives of the
    deceased are Brian's sister AUDREY and her husband JAMES, and
    their teenage son, LIAM, dressed in a suit. They are sitting
    on a couch next to Brian, leafing through a photo album.

Jake doesn't play any sports, and it's probably a point of
contention between father and son, given the sudden

          horrible pitcher; he hated summer
          but went nuts seeing the ladies
          walk by in mini-skirts; and he was
          the most loyal friend you could

</b>
      A tree-filled park in the middle of a quiet Brooklyn
      neighborhood. On a grassy lawn, a GROUP OF BOYS, 12 to 15
      years old, are kicking a soccer ball into a goal. Two
      captains, UMAR and JOEY, are choosing one by one to form two
      teams.

      Tony rushes by on his scooter, fast. He avoids bumps - he
      knows the area by heart. As he approaches the group of boys,
      one of the boys tries to stop him.

      But Tony doesn't stop, and now comes Jake behind on his
      ROLLER BLADES, trying to catch up. He's surprised by a bump
      on the road, makes a false move, and almost falls.

<b>                          JOEY
</b>                Oops! Watch out, Katy Perry!

      All the boys laugh. Jake is upset but keeps going, pretending
      he didn't hear anything.


<b>17A   INT. JARDINE HOUSE/STAIRWELL - DAY                       17A

      The boys enter the foyer of an old NYC tenement apartment
      building. Tony carries his scooter, while Jake tries to take
      off his blades as fast as he can.

      They clomp up several flights.


<b>18    INT. LEONOR'S APARTMENT - DAY                             18
</b>
      An old apartment, functional and in need of paint job. Modest
      furniture dominates the space, but there are a couple of eye
      catching art pieces; a large modernist painting and a
      striking sculpture. In a corner, there's a large bookshelf
      filled with books, but one corner has been turned into a bar
      with a few different types of glasses, and various liquor
      bottles.

      Leonor is in the living room preparing a drink next to HERNÀN
      ALONSO, Latin, early 60's, dressed in a suit and tie. He
      stands close to Leonor, and leans over to help her with the
      drink. At this very moment, Jake and Tony burst in through
      the door.

      Jake stays by the door, polite, waiting to greet the elders,

Tony grabs a glass and opens the refrigerator to get some
water.

          Jake, this is Hernàn.

He finishes his glass of water, and runs to his room. Jake
stays alone with the adults.

</b>               I like it a lot. It's more peaceful
               than Manhattan, and we have much
               more space. It's great.

     This conversation is getting too deep for Jake. Leonor sees
     that he's uncomfortable, and helps him out.

<b>                         LEONOR

     Tony's room is typical teenager with a small bed, a desk with
     computer and posters of music and movies. Tony's on the bed,
     lost in thought. He's clearly been listening in on the
     conversation in the other room.

Tony jumps off his bed and pulls open the drawers of his
desk.

</b>          Not to act. The genesis of acting

<b>                    LEONOR
</b>          You know, your father never thought
          much about contracts. He was very
          happy to have me here. Max thought
          my store gave "glamour" to the
          neighborhood, and he was proud to
          be associated.

<b>                     BRIAN
</b>          The situation has changed, and now
          we have two families owning the

<b>                    BRIAN
</b>          Leonor, this neighborhood is
          changing very fast. The rents have
          gone up quite a lot in the past few
          years. I'm sure you've noticed.

<b>                    LEONOR
</b>          Yes, I noticed and so did Max. But
          it was his desire that I stay here.

<b>                    BRIAN
</b>          We don't want you to go away. My
          sister Audrey has prepared a new
          lease for you, and we think it's
          very fair. We aren't trying to get
          market rate here, we know that's
          not possible, but still, you can't
          expect to pay the same rent you
          paid when you first moved in.

Brian pulls some papers out of his bag.

          fashioned way. It's completely
          different than seeing them on a
          cellphone, don't you agree?

Brian looks through the photos. Leonor looks over his
shoulder.

          Your father and I were very good
          friends. We spent a lot of time
          together. What you and your sister
          don't understand is that Max wanted
          me to stay here. He thought of me
          as part of this house, this

He returns the photos to Leonor.

<b>                    LEONOR
</b>          You hardly talked to each other.
          You never came to visit. I was the
          one here. I saw him everyday.

<b>                    BRIAN
</b>          This is not what I came here for.

          Take a look, please. It's fair.

<b>                    LEONOR
</b>          No, I don't need to. I have an idea
          what you and your sister have in
          mind. I'll just give this to my
          lawyer because, to be honest with
          you, Brian, I'm not sure I owe you
          anything. Maybe it's the other way
          around.

finish sewing. Leonor pulls the pants away from the machine,
and breaks the thread with her teeth.

               you is we will give you time, but
               we need this money. We need the
               shop to cover its rent. That's not
               an unfair thing to ask of a tenant.

</b>               But I'm not a tenant. To Max I was
               more than a tenant. I was family. I
               belong here. And before you go any
               further; let me ask you: do you
               know how much work I've done here?

     It's Studio 54 for KIDS and young TEENAGERS. Jake emerges
     from the bathroom and discovers a dance floor packed with
     boys and girls dancing in groups or doing solo numbers.

     Some come up with elaborate choreographies, while others just
     shake their bodies best they can. Many of them are in
     costumes, some with lights blinking, laser flash lights and
     other Disco toys.

     each other - no choreography here, just plain dancing and
     having fun. He gives it all he's got, admiring her, while she
     closes her eyes, and lets the music take her away.

     She opens her eyes, and sees Tony looking at her. Julia
     smiles at him and they have a little moment dancing. Tony
     feels confident.

     A couple of GIRLS begin to dance with Julia, and Tony

</b>               Dresses go over there, on that rack
               on the left. Before you hang them,
               make sure they have a price tag.
               Also, try to arrange them by color,
               or tone. I usually like to start
               with lighter colors in the front,
               and end with darker ones. Black
               goes in the back. The women here
               like black a lot, so if they're
               looking for a little black dress,
               they might see a lot of other stuff
               before they get there.

               they want, I try to keep them here
               in the front first, and then show
               them the ones in the back.

          It's just the way it is, Leonor.
          I'm fortunate enough to have had a

that story I told you, about my
friend Tina?

<b>          JAKE
</b>The one who sold her hair in India
for a train ticket?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>No, that was Martine. Tina was a
girl I knew in high school who was
a dancer. Her mother was a dancer.
She was literally born to be a
dancer. She had a perfect ballet
dancer's body, and all of us were
certain she was going to be a big
success.

<b>          JAKE
</b>Have I seen her dance?

<b>          BRIAN
</b>No. During high school, she got
into a really good conservatory,
and I ran into her a couple of
times after that, and she was
always about to get this, or about
to get that. But each time, her arm
would be in a sling, or she would
be on crutches. She would have a
pulled ligament. Or a stress
fracture in her back. The last time
I saw her, I ran into her on the
subway, it was clear she hadn't
danced for years. She was fat. You
would have never imagined that she
was the same girl.

<b>          JAKE
</b>Gee, thanks Dad. That's a very

</b>          She trained too hard. She practiced
          too much. She didn't trust her own
          natural abilities.

He continues to wrap the bandage.

<b>                    BRIAN
</b>          Jake, you're going to meet a lot of
          really talented people in your
          life. But they won't all be suited
          to be artists, they won't all have
          the brains to know when to insist,
          and when to stop. When to push
          yourself, and when to relax. Most
          of them won't have that balance.

<b>                    JAKE

          balance?

</b>          That's why I'm telling you this,
          because you'll turn in your
          portfolio soon, and they're going
          to love it. They're going to love
          you. I know they will. You'll go to
