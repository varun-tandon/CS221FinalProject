</b>           Millions of years ago , a meteorite
           made of vibranium, the strongest
           substance in the universe struck
           the continent of Africa affecting
           the plant life around it.

          The meteorite hits Africa and we see plant life and animals
          affected by vibranium.

</b>           And when the time of man came , five
           tribes settled on it and called it
           Wakanda. The tribes lived in
           constant war with each other until
           a warrior shaman received a vision
           from the Panther goddess Bast who
           led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a
           plant that granted him super human
           strength , speed, and instincts.


          A visual representation of the five tribes emerges as hands
          from the sand animation, and we see them unite , and then
          break apart as conflict arises . Bashenga rises above the
          conflict and eats the Heart Shaped Herb, proceeding to unite
          the tribes .

           first Black Panther , the protector
           of Wakanda .

</b>           Four tribes agreed to live under
           the King's rule , but the Jabari
           tribe isolated themselves in the
           mountains.

          We see the Jabari striding off towards the isolated mountain
          region.

<b>                          FATHER (CONT'D)
</b>           The Wakandans used vibranium to
           develop technology more advanced
           than any other nation , but as
           Wakanda thrived the world around it
           descended further into chaos.

          We see images of war and slavery just outside Wakanda ' s
          secretive border .

<b>                          FATHER (CONT'D)
</b>           To keep vibranium safe , the
           Wakandans vowed to hide in plain
           sight, keeping the truth of their
           power from the outside world.

          We see the protective barrier rise around the Wakandan city ,
          as we pull back on the Earth as it spins, now zooming in on
          another part of the world ..·
