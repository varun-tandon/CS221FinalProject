    The LOUVRE MUSEUM -- with its 16th-Century architecture
    and its I.M. Pei glass-and-metal PYRAMIDS -- a place
    where the past and the future meet.

    DIANA PRINCE (30), antiquities expert, strides towards
    the Louvre, passing ARMED MILITARY at guard and alert.

    A TRUCK pulls up, blocking our VIEW. ARMED SECURITY
    OFFICERS exit, unloading a CRATE from WAYNE ENTERPRISES
    addressed to DIANA PRINCE: CURATOR.

    Diana walks down a HALLWAY with Assyrian bas-relief
    sculptures showing the good, and the bad, of humanity
    throughout history. She takes this in.

    The CRATE is delivered to Diana -- a wall-mounted
    COLLECTION OF ANCIENT WEAPONRY and GREEK ANTIQUITIES
    behind her.

    She eyes the WAYNE ENTERPRISES LOGO warily.

    Now alone at her desk, Diana opens the crate and looks
    inside, stunned.

    REVEAL THE ORIGINAL DAGUERREOTYPE of Diana from BvS --
    She's in her WONDER WOMAN ARMOR, surrounded by a band of
    SOLDIERS -- her friends -- from long ago.

    She holds up the unsigned note accompanying the photo:

    "I found the original.   Maybe one day you'll tell me your
    story."

    She contemplates the faces of her friends long dead. Her
    eyes focus in on a man we'll soon know as STEVE TREVOR.
    She lingers on him, and then drifts to herself.

    Surrounded by HISTORY, Diana is overwhelmed by the memory
    of how this photo -- and Wonder Woman -- came to be --

    THE PAST. Flashes of AMAZONS as they train for COMBAT on
    VARIOUS PLATEAUS extending from the edge of the CLIFFS of
    Themyscira.

    The Amazons train with WEAPONS, CLASHING and TESTING one
    another to their limits.

    DOZENS of ARMORED FEMALE WARRIORS -- AMAZONS -- engage in
    a dazzling array of training exercises. Every Amazon is
    an ageless beauty, between 30 and 50. They spar with BO
    STAVES, KNIVES, SWORDS. Practice ARCHERY, SPEAR
    THROWING, and LASSO from HORSEBACK. It's breathtaking --

    -- and YOUNG DIANA (8), Princess of Themyscira, watches
    it all from the edge of the field. Her eyes blaze with
    admiration.

    ANTIOPE, the demanding GENERAL, oversees the Amazons.
    She wears a distinctive HELMET. At her side, the Amazon
    PHILIPPUS (African, regal).

    Diana fixates on one Amazon in particular, FIERCE and
    POWERFUL -- ARTEMIS. She sends her opponent to the
    GROUND, then SPINS to face another!

              every step must find a safe spot --

    Diana REHEARSES Artemis' moves, her young face set in a
    fierce scowl. She stabs at imaginary enemies, then looks
    up to find --

    Antiope STARING AT HER from across the grounds. She's
    caught! But instead of hiding -- she looks back to
    Antiope: I'm ready to fight! LET ME TRY!

    Antiope shakes her head but smiles -- Diana smiles back.

    Diana dashes through the crowded   marketplace, hoping to
    lose Mnemosyne, but every Amazon   whose path she crosses
    greets her with a smile or "Good   morning, Princess!"
    "Hello, Diana!" We realize that    Diana is the ONLY CHILD
    in this world.

    Diana races past a MURAL in the public square of QUEEN
    HIPPOLYTA, Diana's mother, triumphantly leading the
    Amazons.

    escape! She darts up it and back down another straight
    into a DEAD END.

    Looking for a way out, she sees a long jump she just
    might make. There's a big fall, but Diana loves a
    challenge! She smiles mischievously, runs and LEAPS --

    -- but she's NOT GOING TO MAKE IT! Diana stretches out,
    her face falling as she realizes she's missed the jump,
    when --

    A hand grabs her wrist!

    Dangling, Diana's pulled up to see: QUEEN HIPPOLYTA,
    ethereally beautiful, holding Diana easily by one arm as
    if Diana weighed nothing. She sits HORSEBACK, the
    mounted QUEEN'S GUARD behind her.

    Diana twists uneasily, smiling up at her mother.

               Zeus king among them.

     PUSH IN as the painting seems to come alive, subtly
     animates. Lightning and thunder herald the arrival of
     ZEUS atop Olympus, surrounded by the PANTHEON OF GODS.

     hidden in shadow beneath a fearsome, HORNED HELMET.

        APHRODITE, Goddess of Love, stands beside Zeus and the
        other gods at the shore of a turbulent sea, waving her
        hands as the ocean churns.

        From out of the sea rises: HIPPOLYTA, ANTIOPE, and
        countless other figures -- WARRIOR WOMEN.

                  even a unity among the world, as

                  side against a great evil.

        An ancient war is subtly depicted, but not lingered on.
        If one looks close you'll see: THREE ARMIES -- The gods,
        Amazons, and Atlanteans battling JACOB. Each army in
        possession of a LOTUS.

     Pushed to her limit, Diana brings both arms up -- then
     SLAMS her bracelets together!

     We get the sense that this is just the beginning of her
     true POWER. Still, it's powerful enough to knock Antiope
     off her feet. Diana stumbles back...

     Diana, amazed and elated, realizes that something
     unbelievable has happened. A tiny GOLDEN SPARK in her
     eye quickly fades.

     Diana's ecstatic, scared and confused.   She looks to her
     mother: Did you see that?

     But Hippolyta is worried about the implications of
     Diana's power -- and Diana mistakes it for judgment.

     Diana races up a grassy embankment to a CLIFF overlooking
     the ocean.

     She looks down at her open palms, clenches them shut.

     What was that?   Then --

     An UNFAMILIAR SOUND: a strange gnawing BUZZ.     Diana
     looks upward, quickly spotting --

     A SHAPE on the horizon, moving closer. Something she has
     never seen before: A GERMAN WARPLANE, a Fokker, out of
     control, trailing SMOKE.

     Diana's sharp gaze catches sight of SOMEONE IN THE
     COCKPIT, struggling to escape.

     The PLANE dives down, crashing into the water!

     Without hesitation, Diana DIVES off the cliff, hurtling
     hundreds of feet through the air and into the sea.

     He struggles to break free from the cockpit, but his
     MESSENGER BAG is caught!

     A loud CREEEEAAAK pierces the water. The PILOT looks up
     to see a deep FISSURE running along the tail. It BREAKS
     free and the engine and cockpit sink like stones.

     As he sinks, he loses breath, the light fading.
     Suddenly, out of nowhere, DIANA APPEARS ON THE PLANE'S
     TAIL, above the surface. The sun blazes, framing her, an
     epic vision -- like an angel.

     The PILOT blinks into the light one last time. The DARK
     DEPTHS closing in on his face as his eyes fall shut.

     Diana DIVES in and grabs the Pilot.

     She braces her feet against the plane and rips him away,
     kicking to the surface.

     Diana drags the Pilot onto the beach, his bag around his

     jaw, hair, stubble -- captivating.

     This is CAPTAIN STEVE TREVOR (30s), rugged, handsome.    An
     American fighter pilot undercover for the British.

     Steve wakes, squinting in the sun, surprised to discover
     Diana's not a hallucination. He takes in the strange

<b>30   FLASHBACK - EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION (OTTOMAN EMPIRE) -       30
</b><b>     DAY
</b>
     Steve, in his GERMAN PILOT'S UNIFORM, stands on an
     AIRSTRIP next to several other PILOTS and PLANES.

<b>                                STEVE (V.O.)
</b>                  British Intelligence got word that
                  the leader of the German Army,
                  General Ludendorff, was visiting a
                  secret military installation in
                  the Ottoman Empire.

     large, nondescript WAREHOUSE.

</b>                  According to our intel, the
                  Germans had no troops left, no
                  money, no munitions of any kind...

     Steve discovers this is an immense MUNITIONS FACTORY
     manned by elderly men, women, and children, all of whom
     appear to be slave labor for the Germans in the mass
     production of BOMBS.

<b>                                STEVE (V.O.)

                  Germans had the Turks making bombs
                  for them. And not just bombs...

     Ludendorff   approaches a SCIENTIST, wearing head-to-toe
     protective   gear. Removing mask and goggles, we meet the
     STUNNINGLY   BEAUTIFUL DR. MARU, 40s. She finishes writing
     a CHEMICAL   FORMULA in a NOTEBOOK. She turns, greets
     Ludendorff   with respect and confidence.

               Ludendorff's chief psychopath.
               Dr. Isabel Maru.

     Steve can't help but stare admiringly... until Maru turns
     her head, revealing METAL PLATES on her face, hiding
     damage incurred by her own experiments.

<b>                             STEVE (V.O.)
</b>               Boys in the trenches call her `Dr.
               Poison.'

     Maru leads LUDENDORFF to her lab, to a fully-enclosed
     TEST CHAMBER with a VIEWING WINDOW.

     In the chamber, Steve sees a gruesome site: A PRISONER,
     his terrified face covered by a GAS MASK, his wrists and
     ankles stretched out and restrained by CHAINS. Another
     CHAIN leads from the top of the prisoner's gas mask.

     Out of earshot, Steve watches as Maru shows Ludendorff
     the formulas in her notebook, explaining them.

     Maru closes the notebook and sets it down, then releases
     GLOWING GAS into the chamber. Panicked, the prisoner's
     terrified eyes widen, MUFFLED SCREAMS cry out behind his
     gas mask.

     Enraptured, Maru puts a hand against the window, her
     anxious eyes follow the SMOKE filling the chamber: It
     has to work this time.

     Ludendorff watches, waiting.

     Steve looks on in horror as the prisoner's gas mask
     begins to show slight signs of disintegration: thin
     cracks in the glass, wear on the straps, corrosion on the
     metal -- Maru isn't even aware she's grinning, but then --

     The prisoner realizes the gas mask is resisting the gas,
     protecting him. He calms. Maru's face falls.

     Her eyes dart to Ludendorff who shows obvious signs of
     disappointment.

     Steve watches as a frustrated Dr. Maru pulls a LEVER --
     and the chain connected to the prisoner's gas mask tears
     the mask off, exposing him to what's left of the gas!

     The panicked prisoner screams in pain as he breathes in,
     dying horribly!

     Steve can barely watch, he glances away -- and his eyes
     lock on Maru's notebook.

     installation's glass roof, whose WORKERS have just
     evacuated. He STRAFES it, taking out all of the glass
     panes before dropping HAND-BOMBS into the complex.

     Diana enters to find Steve stepping out of a TUB -- his
     back to her -- NAKED. She studies his body as he towels
     himself dry.

     Steve's shoulder has been BANDAGED, but his body is
     covered with CUTS, BRUISES, SCARS from other battles.
     Diana touches her own wound, sympathetic. Steve finally
     turns, startled to see her there.

     On this still, MOONLIT night, the armory stands
     monolithic amongst the other buildings of Themyscira.

     Diana surveys from an opposing hillside. The building's
     face an impenetrable mountainside, accessible by only one
     main entrance, completely blocked by SEVERAL GUARDS who
     stand watch -- and even if she could take them all on,
     Diana doesn't want to hurt them.

     Studying the building further, she focuses on the SINGLE
     WINDOW in the HIGH TOWER.

     Diana's face darkens with fixed focus. She looks down at
     her feet, back at the space -- calculating it all. She
     turns to the hillside behind her, spots a distant branch
     twisting from a tree. It looks relatively equidistant to
     the armory.

     She takes a step towards it, then another -- and another --
     and Diana leaps into the air, locked on the branch -- but
     she lands far before reaching it!

     As Diana jogs to a stop, her frown fades:      I know that I
     can do this.

     Diana sets off in a dead sprint towards the cliffside --
     she LEAPS over the abyss below. Her face calm as she
     SOARS through the night --

     THE BUILDING BARRELS TOWARDS HER, her eyes widen.
     Thinking fast she GRASPS a SPUR and --

     She SLAMS into the side, holding on. She revels in the
     moment briefly and then sobers: Now what?

     The window is at least 30 feet above her -- below, the
     abyss. The wind MOANS.

     Diana's GRIP TIGHTENS on the spur.

     Suddenly, the SPUR CRACKS!    Diana falls --

     She scrambles against the wall, her hands grasping at the
     stone face. SHARDS FLYING around her, she realizes she's
     strong enough to make her own handholds -- SLAM!

     Her hand catches and she YANKS to a stop!

     Shocked, she hangs there for a second, then grins
     fiercely. She begins to CLIMB her way straight up the
     stone wall, her fingers slamming into the tower, making
     her own ladder out of solid stone.

     In the moonlit darkness of the deserted armory, Diana
     moves towards the GODKILLER SWORD. She takes it from its
     SCABBARD, awed by its weight, its sheer power in her
     hands. She holds it tight. It feels right.

     As she leaves, she passes a suit of ancient armor and
<b>     SNATCHES ITS SHIELD.
</b>
     Then the LASSO OF HESTIA disappears from its hook.

     Diana, now half-dressed in GREEK ARMOR, admires a glowing

     that really catches her eye.

     torque, impact and SOUND.

     Steve takes out SM #1 while Diana grabs SM #3 as his LAST
     SHOT fires -- and lays him out with a blow.

     Diana deflects the last of SM #2's bullets as his gun
     runs EMPTY. Everyone is amazed, especially Steve --

     The remaining THREE SUITED MEN rush Steve and Diana.
     Diana slams her fist into SM #2 while Steve takes on SM
<b>     #4.

     Diana grabs the dazed SM #2 -- swings him around,
     crashing him into SM #5 hard -- and they're both down.    A
     spilt second later, Steve finishes taking out SM #4.

     The suited men run off, leaving only SM #1 behind. SM #1
     stirs. Diana and Steve turn to see him make a run for it --

     GODKILLER, shopping bags at her feet.

     SM #1 runs in the other direction, but Diana retrieves
     the LASSO from inside her coat and uses it to pull him
     off his feet, onto his back.

     As the lasso glows, Diana kneels at his side,
     compassionately placing her hand on his chest.    In her
     mind, his actions are not his fault.

     nods toward the door, then realizes the room has gone

     Every eye in the hall is fixed on Diana, the only woman
     in a room that doesn't allow women. Diana, oblivious,
     looks up at Sir Patrick.

      TIGHT ON: a GAS CANISTER.   Maru turns a valve on it,
      adjusting the pressure.

      She screws the canister onto the side of a small GLASS
      CHAMBER containing a GAS MASK. She locks the canister in
      place, then releases the gas into the chamber.

      Ludendorff and Maru watch as the NEW GAS hisses in,
      creeping towards the gas mask, enveloping it.

      The mask begins to disintegrate -- thin cracks in the
      glass, wear on the straps, corrosion on the metal. It's
      just as it was before.

      Maru, filled with anticipation, wonders: Will it work
      this time? It does. The gas continues, eating away at
      the mask -- the glass cracks apart, the straps sever, the
      metal breaks. A sign of the pain and horror it will soon
      inflict. It is Maru's greatest achievement -- then even
      the glass chamber itself starts to shudder -- and crack!

     The atmosphere is weirdly JUBILANT and GUNG HO. Two
     sikhs ride through the station on bicycles, a WILLFUL
     LITTLE GIRL runs away from her mother, NURSES and WOMEN
     FACTORY WORKERS board the train, solemnly and
     purposefully.

     Diana takes in an array of HUMAN EMOTION. Mothers
     CRYING, fathers PROUD, sons COMMITTED and BRAVE, going
     off to war. GIRLFRIENDS are swept passionately into
     BOYFRIEND'S ARMS. DOGS are scooped up and hugged
     goodbye.

     Diana's eyes well as Steve checks his WATCH.

     looks around at what she's seeing, then back at her a
     beat longer than he would expect.

     Diana watches a MAN and his DAUGHTER walk away from an
     ICE CREAM VENDOR, eating an ICE CREAM CONE. Steve spots

     Then Diana sees something odd as they board the train: a
     PUNCH &amp; JUDY PUPPET SHOW, one puppet hitting the other --
     people LAUGHING at the violence -- and to her, that's
     very strange. Almost ominous.

     firm.

     Steve looks at her, still thinking she's a bit crazy --

     one foot. To stay on balance, she does so with the
     opposite. Suddenly, Chief and Diana are arm wrestling,
     each trying to throw the other off balance. Then Chief

     The tables are crowded with VILLAGERS and all the food
     the Germans left behind. Beer flows. Tea lights
     twinkle. A FEMALE PIANIST plays, singing as couples
     dance. The atmosphere is warm and jovial.

     Diana and Steve stand at the edge of the crowd, unable to
     put the urgency of their mission aside and join in.

     Steve finally smiles and moves out onto the floor to join

     Diana moves a bit closer to Steve, smiles. The music
     changes as a NEW PIANIST begins a beautiful melody,
     breaking into song with an incredible TENOR VOICE.

     Diana and Steve look towards the piano and see that it is
     CHARLIE WHO IS PLAYING AND SINGING. Diana can't help but
     be surprised once again by these men.

     Sameer and The Chief join the people crowding around
     Charlie, smiling, laughing, grateful.

     As the emotional song continues, they sway for a beat,
     holding each other and then a SINGLE SNOWFLAKE falls.

     Diana looks up as more and more white ice falls from the
     sky, sprinkling her hair. She holds out a palm, CATCHING
     A FLAKE and sniffing it.

     Through the trees, still on HORSEBACK, Diana and the team

     Chauffeured LIMOUSINES go through a HEAVILY-GUARDED

     delivering well-dressed GUESTS to the ENTRANCE of the

     The Chief gets off his horse, hands the reins to Sameer,

      her bracelet, ricocheting it back at Ludendorff's gun!
      It explodes in his hand! He cries out in pain, shocked!

      Diana lowers her smoking bracelet, looking him in the

      display of power.

      Ludendorff turns away from Diana, cracking open a BLUE

      bulging.

      Diana sees Ludendorff's veins bulging, almost
      supernatural -- her eyes widen with confirmation.

      Diana moves quickly, thrusting the Godkiller at him. He
      dodges it. She strikes him in the face with her fist.
      They trade blows.

      He grabs a BAYONETTED RIFLE mounted on the wall.
      Ludendorff uses the rifle as A GUN, A SPEAR, and A SWORD.
      He HITS Diana again and again -- but Diana strikes back
      with such FORCE that he flies backwards through the
      WINDOW and onto the narrow walkway outside.

      Diana CHARGES AGAIN. Ludendorff manages to escape being
      gored by CLIMBING UP TO THE TOWER ROOF.

      Ludendorff stands, holding his bayonet, as Diana LEAPS up
      on the roof to join him -- and the BATTLE RAGES on, SWORD
      AGAINST BAYONET, both so close to plummeting to the
      ground with every volley.

      But then Ludendorff lands a BLOW that sends Diana and his
      bayonet sliding over the roof's edge. She manages to
      grip the ledge but loses the Godkiller.

      blade with her BARE HANDS.

      It cuts deep, drawing blood, she CRIES OUT in pain.

      Summoning impossible strength, she grips the blade and
      SHOVES it back with such force that Ludendorff loosens
      his grip. For the first time we see that he is afraid.

      Diana stands over Ludendorff, raising the GODKILLER.

      The battlefield is quiet. A storm begins to simmer in

       catches the shell, throwing it back at the tank! As it
       explodes, German soldiers RUN -- until Ares sees them --
       and using his growing power, takes them over. They all
       freeze in place.

       The soldiers AIM their guns at Diana, firing dozens and

       her eyes begin to DARKEN.

       She's lost in Steve's death, transformed into a VIOLENT
       MACHINE! In a brutal, stunning move, Diana attacks the
       soldiers in a fit of rage. She decimates the soldiers!
       One after the other! Tearing through them!

       She spins through the crowd, slamming into the soldiers --
       building to a SUPER SPIN that blows them all back!

       Diana charges Ares, flipping over and around him, dodging
       his sword, kicking him, leaping away, landing, and
       throwing her LASSO around his leg.

       She wraps her lasso around her own leg, flipping him over
       her head, slamming him down onto the ground!

       Diana leaps into the air, smashing her elbow into his
       back. Breathing heavily, full of anger, Diana pulls Ares
       up, getting close enough to realize --

       ARES IS SMILING.   She's almost his.

      On the SAME CLIFF where Diana saw Steve's plane,
      HIPPOLYTA stands on the shore, looking out over the
      ocean, thinking about her daughter.

      A beat. Then Hippolyta turns -- as if she hears
      something -- just as VENELIA rides up to her. Venelia
      dismounts.
