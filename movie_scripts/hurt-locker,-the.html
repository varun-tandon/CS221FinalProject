          A grainy, low-resolution view, seen from sixteen inches above
          street level. And we're moving fast -- nauseatingly fast.
                         
          From this angle close to the ground we FLY down a road strewn
          with war garbage: munitions, trash, rubber, animal shit --
          all of which, from this odd, jarring perspective, looks
          gigantic, monstrous.
                         
          We zoom towards a crumpled COKE CAN, the white `C' growing
          enormous on the screen, filling the screen like a skyscraper.
                         
          We SMASH into the can and barrel ahead.
                         
          A RAG flutters, blocks the view, then tumbles away, as we --
                         
          -- zoom downhill, see nothing but gray sand, then zoom back
          up hill and off, catching air, a flash of the horizon line,
          BRIGHT SUN, and land hard on a packed road.
                         
          We close in on one particular pile of trash, which is topped
          with a white plastic garbage bag, and stop. Puffs of dust
          and fluttering plastic.
                         
          We glide across the fluttering plastic. Flies buzzing.
          Advancing slowly, inch by inch, to the edge for our first
          glimpse inside the bag:

          A military ROBOT (about 3 feet long and 2 feet high, aka `the
          bot') that rolls on tank-like treads and has a mechanical
          hand and an array of CAMERAS is moving around the bag.

          This is all taking place on a dusty stretch of road in a

          cement houses and a couple of parked cars.

          SOUND of far off GUNSHOTS and CALL to prayer.
                         
          SEVERAL U.S. INFANTRY SOLDIERS are moving PEDESTRIANS away
          from the bag. Another group of SOLDIERS is clearing out all
          the shops: bakery, sandwich shop, and a butcher shop.
                         
          Next to a parked Humvee, THREE EOD (Explosive Ordinance
          Disposal, aka Bomb Squad) SOLDIERS are crouched over a laptop
          computer, looking at the screen and the same image of the
          metal artillery shell inside the fluttering plastic.
                         
          SERGEANT MATT THOMPSON wipes at the sweat on his forehead.
          This is summer in the desert and the median temperature on
          this bright clear morning is 110 degrees.

          Thompson   tears open a mushy Snicker's. He is fleshy around
          the arms   and middle, but there's real muscle underneath the
          flab and   truth be told, after so many years in EOD, he's lost
          the need   to have a show-off build.

          SERGEANT J. T. SANBORN works the joystick on the laptop. He
          is a strapping Iowa farm boy, with a thick back from bailing
          hay. In contrast to his bulky frame, his face is soft, open,
          kind. He has a relaxed demeanor. Which might lead you to
          think nothing ever bothers Sanborn. But if you thought that,
          you'd be mistaken. Before joining EOD, Sanborn was in
          Military Intelligence. He quit. Military Intel was too easy.

          The third soldier leans in for a better look.
                         
          SPECIALIST OWEN ELDRIDGE is a tall, lanky young man, the
          youngest of the group. He's a fighter like the others but
          also a reader, and something of a thinker. Eldridge crouches
          behind the other two soldiers, sipping a bottle of water,
          eyes never leaving the screen.

          Eldridge gets up and goes to the Humvee, fishes around
          inside.

          Eldridge is already on it, approaching with the four blocks
          of C4. He's done this enough to know what they need.

          Now we see the tiny toy robot in the far distance -- far, far
          away.
                         
          Behind the Humvee and on either side of the road INFANTRY
          SOLDIERS are still clearing civilian onlookers from nearby
          stores.

                    and most of the shrapnel is going

          like an astronaut suit and helmet crossed with the Michelin
          Man. Because of its weight and complexity it takes two men to
          put it on - or one Sanborn.
                         
          Sanborn kneels down and guides Thompson's feet into the
          suit's black boots, then lashes up a series of Velcro straps
          to secure the armor, like a squire working on a knight.

          reaches for his pistol -- but the man disappears from view --

          AMBASSADOR SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES, the epitome of the old style
          of British foreign service: elegant, self assured, a
          gentleman adventurer in Seville Row, hoping to improve the
          world, certain he'll profit in the attempt.
                         
          He's holding court with a group of EXECUTIVES. The executives
          are seated around a conference table under the Ambassador's
          sway. There's a model of a British Petroleum gas
          station/convenience store, in English and Arabic, in the
          center of the table.

          The soldiers are gathered around the pit to see EOD work.
          It's not everyday you get to see an eight foot missile towed
          out of a hole.
                         
          James is down in the pit. Sanborn hands him a chain. Working
          together, they wrap it around the missile. When they're done,
          Sanborn signals Eldridge, who is behind the wheel of the
          Humvee, ready to tow the missile out of the crater.

          The chain creaks, then stops. The tires spin uselessly.

          The tires only spin faster.
                         
          Sanborn moves to get a closer look. His knees come very near
          to the creaking chain.

          Sanborn grabs Eldridge. And they dive back into the pit,
          joining James and THREE SOLDIERS: a SERGEANT one PRIVATE and

          Outside, a storm is brewing.

          covered by bruises and blood and further obscured by the
          shadows and dappled light, that it could be the face of
          almost any young man.
                         
          The violence done to the face exerts an odd pull on James.

          The dead young man's chest has been cut open. An artillery
          shell is shoved inside the cavity where the heart used to
          beat. Wires protrude from the shell. It's meant to be a booby

          Now that the Colonel is fully visible in the light we can see

          The Colonel nods and moves off. His translator stands for a
          moment. Takes off his ski mask to reveal an intelligent face
          with deep set eyes and a dirty smear of five o'clock shadow.

          Sanborn casts a nervous look around the poverty-stricken
          neighborhood. It has taken on a forboding vibe in the
          unrelenting storm.

          He uses a long pole to open the door of the washing machine.
          It's empty inside.
                         
          Getting closer, he sees the washing machine timer is at 30
          minutes. James rests his head on the timer, listening.
                         
          He turns his attention to the back of the washing machine,
          unscrewing the rear plate.
                         
          Inside, just a tangle of wires. He traces the wires with his
          hand. Shrugs.
                         
          Then he turns back to the front of the machine. He twists the
          timer with his hand, slowly, all the way back to zero.

          new man. His hair has grown, softening his features. He's
          scrubbed clean, dust free, and dressed in Bermuda shorts and
          a clashing Polo shirt. The All American Dad. A suburban
          softie. Pushing a shopping cart.

          A beautiful young WOMAN approaches him from the other end of
          the aisle. She too, is pushing a shopping cart, and in it is

          James stops. Hands tight on the shopping cart. He looks at

          James clears his throat. She sees him. Moves her cart.

          James is washing the vegetables they've just bought at the
          grocery store. Mushrooms bob in a pool of water at the bottom
          of the sink. James tries to clean them individually, but
          can't. They crumble in his hands.

          James struggles with the mushrooms. Makes no reply.

          A few NEIGHBORS have gathered for a barbecue in James'
          backyard. It's a simple, low-key affair. James is tending
          meat on a grill.

          The boy is in a cradle, face up and wide awake. James comes
          in to tuck him in.
                         
          James pulls a book of fairy tales off the shelf, flips
          through it. Can't read that fluff.
                         
          He pulls up a chair. Begins to play with a Jack-In-the-Box.
          He winds it up.
                         
          He opens it for his son. The Jack POPs out.
                         
          His son squeals with delight, then his eyes go wide with
          fear. He's not sure what to make of the bobbing clown.

          James looks at the box. He stuffs the Jack back in and closes
          it.
                         
          The boy looks up at him with a son's pure admiration. Rapt.

                     one.
                         
          He brings the box close to the child's eyes. The boy is
          dazzled by the colors. He reaches out to touch it.

                    Then a new king came along and told
                    all the people, you have to give me
                    all your magic boxes. But the
                    people, instead of giving away
                    their boxes decided to hide them.
                    And they put their boxes in secret
                    places all over the kingdom. They
                    put them in the roads. They put
                    them in cars. They put them in
                    buildings. And the King said, (does
                    a King's gravelly baritone) "Well,
                    how am I going to get my magic
                    boxes now?" And one of the King's
                    men said, "We have a special Knight
                    with special armor, and he can find
                    the boxes. And only he.
                         
          He tries to collect his thoughts.

</b>                    And this Knight gathered up all the
                    boxes, far and wide. And sometimes -
                    - when he wasn't sure if it was a
                    magic box -- he opened them.
                         
          James slowly opens the box, holding the clown in with his
          hand so it doesn't pop. Releasing it slowly.
                         
          The boy giggles and reaches up.

                    you have done a wonderful job. I
                    will grant you one wish. What do
                    you wish?

          continue the conversation. When none comes, she moves on.
                         
          James turns to the window. In his hand he holds a photo of
          his son.
                         
          Tears well up.

          A Middle-Eastern sun bathes James' upturned face lengthening
          into a smile.
                         
          His pace slows...the tarmac transitions to dirt as little

          Hands pat his back as he begins the long walk down the street
