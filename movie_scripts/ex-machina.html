    office.

    In a kitchen area, young men and women mill and chat.
    Casually dressed. Feels like an intelligent, relaxed
    environment.

    Behind them, more young men and women sit at desks, in front
    of screens and keyboard.

    Each workstation is personalised. Photographs of friends or
    family, or pets. Cutting from magazines. Ironic
    superhero/video-game figurines.

    - the hands of the young man writing code.   This is CALEB.
    He types fast, with two fingers.

    Looking back at CALEB.

    Twenty four. Glazed. Ear buds in, connected to cell phone.
    Head bobbing slightly to the music.

    As we watch from the monitor POV, we can see the computer's
    facial recognition system in operation.

Imaged as vector boxes, which track CALEB'S face, and the

On which a message appears, in a small window, over the code.

As CALEB stops typing.

He gazes at the message.

Then clicks on the link.
Then mouths the word: Fuck.

CALEB reaches for his cell phone.

<b>CUT TO -

- the CELL PHONE POV, seen from the tiny camera above the
screen, as CALEB lifts the phone, and starts keying-in a
text.

We see facial recognition software flickering over CALEB'S
features, and reacting to shifts in his expression.

- the cell phone. The screen.   The tiny camera nestled above
it. Lens glinting.

On the screen, a time-bar extends next to the word:

    Behind CALEB, a few of the people behind CALEB in the office
    are reacting.

    One stands and applauds.
    A GIRL comes out from behind her desk, runs over to CALEB,
    and embraces him from behind planting a kiss on his cheek.

    CALEB still looks dazed.

    He still has his headphones in. Still in the audio bubble,
    which, despite the commotion around him, remains unburst.

    A spectacular mountain landscape. Waterfalls drop down
    massive rock faces to inland lakes. Rivers push through
    forest. Forest spreads across valley floors, which rise to
    snow peaks.

    CALEB wakes abruptly -

    - to find himself in the front seat of a helicopter.

    The pilot, JAY, is a man in his forties.

    Outside the window is the mountain landscape.

CALEB looks around.   Wipes sleep out of his eyes.   Gets his
bearings.

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          Damn. Can't believe I've been

JAY smiles.

Beat.

The pilot laughs.

          one of these mountain ridges.

JAY shrugs.

</b>          Assume it was him, anyway. No one
          else around for a hundred miles.

JAY glances over at CALEB.

</b>          So how does a programmer from Long
          Island get to be meeting the CEO?

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          I won a competition. It was kind
          of like a lottery, for employees.
          The winner got to spend a week with
          him.

JAY chuckles.

</b><b>    EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY
</b>
    The helicopter flies over the lip of a WATERFALL, revealing a
    valley.

    The valley floor is a forest, and a single bright green
    meadow. Sunlit, like a jewel in the icy mountains.

    A white-water river runs through it.

</b><b>    EXT. MEADOW/LANDING SITE - DAY

    Meadow flowers whip in the rotor wash as the helicopter
    touches down in the vast meadow.

    By the landing site is a collection of huge metal crates.
    All have Chinese characters on the side.

    The rotor blades slow, but don't stop.

    JAY exits.

</b><b>    EXT. MEADOW/LANDING SITE - DAY
</b>
    JAY holds open the door as CALEB exits the helicopter cabin.

    CALEB looks around, his eyes adjusting to the bright sunshine
    outside.

    JAY goes to the side of the helicopter, pops open a hatch,
    and removes CALEB'S luggage. A large suitcase with wheels.

    CALEB looks around. Apart from the packing crates, there are
    no man-made structures to be seen.

    CALEB shouts over the engine noise.

<b>                           CALEB
</b>                 You're leaving me here?

</b>               This is as close as I'm allowed to
               the building.

<b>                         CALEB
</b>               ... What building?

     The pilot gestures vaguely towards the white water.

<b>                         JAY
</b>               Follow the river.

     JAY hands CALEB his bag.

<b>                         JAY (CONT'D)
</b>               Please get a safe distance from the

     The pilot gets back inside the helicopter, and closes the
     door.

     CALEB hurriedly retreats with his bag.
     Moments later, in a roar of wind and noise, the helicopter is
     lifting off.

     Equally suddenly, the noise is fading, and the helicopter is
     soaring upwards, and banking back towards the glacier.

     Then it is gone.    Bird song and wind rush replace engine
     noise.

     CALEB suddenly looks very isolated.

</b><b>     EXT. RIVER - DAY
</b>
     CALEB walks along the banks of the fast-flowing river,
     awkwardly bumping his wheeled suitcase over the ground.

     The banks of the river start to climb, to an intimidating
     drop.

     It feels that this can't be the right way.

     CALEB reaches into his pocket and pulls out his mobile phone.

     No signal at all.

     He puts his phone back in his pocket.

</b><b>     EXT. RIVER/HOUSE VIEW - DAY

     CALEB rounds a bend in the river.

     Ahead, almost hidden in trees, there is a steel and glass
     structure.
<b>                                                                 8.

</b><b>      EXT. CLEARING - DAY
</b>
      CALEB walks towards the house through the trees.

      In the ground, in a grassy clearing, he finds a circular
      window, reflecting the sky.

      He walks up to the window, and looks inside.

      It reveals what is effectively a glass-covered well - about
      four metres deep, with smooth concrete sides.

      At the bottom of the well is a brightly-lit room, which
      appears to be an office of some sort. There is a desk, with
      monitors, and a chair.

      But apparently no one inside.

      Beyond the clearing, in the tree-line, CALEB sees - almost
      camouflaged by forest - the dark shapes and straight lines of
      a low, one storey building complex.

</b><b>      EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</b>
      CALEB approaches the building.

      As he nears the entrance -

      - CALEB startles, as an AUTOMATED VOICE speaks to him, from
      an unknown source.

<b>                          AUTOMATED VOICE
</b>                Caleb Smith.

      CALEB tracks the source of the voice.

      Near what seems to be the front door, a pillar protrudes from
      the ground. Head-height. With a GLASS SCREEN on one side.

      Below the screen is a DISPENSER.

<b>                            CALEB

                face the screen.

      CALEB looks into the screen, and as soon as he has locked
      eyes with his own reflection, the screen FLASHES. A single
      bright strobe.

      Almost immediately afterwards, something small clatters into
      the DISPENSER.

      CALEB picks the object up.      It's a credit-card sized ID.

      On it, there is an embedded chip, and a photograph of his
      face. He looks comically surprised.

<b>                            CALEB

      CALEB walks up to the front door.

      Beside the door, a KEYCARD PLATE is set into the wall, with a
<b>      RED LED LIGHT.
</b>
      He holds his keycard ID.

      The RED LED light changes to BLUE.

      CALEB pushes the front door, and it swings open.

</b><b>      INT. HOUSE/MAIN ROOM - DAY

      The front door opens to a glass-walled staircase, which leads
      down to an open-plan room.

      At the bottom of the staircase, CALEB waits to see if he is
      welcomed, or noticed.

      But he is not.

      Silence.

      Then he is startled a second time, by sudden commencement of
      a THUMPING SOUND.

      Abrupt.    Rapid.    More or less rhythmic.   From somewhere
      nearby.

      He exits in the direction of the noise.

      CALEB enters a dining area.

      Which now reveals...

      ... a huge glass door.

      It presents an arresting view of a garden, river, and the
      mountains behind.

</b>

     The door is open, and through it, we see the reason for the
     thumping sound.

     Just outside, on a patio, in the sunshine, a man is working a
<b>     PUNCH BAG.
</b>
<b>14                                                                  14
</b><b>     EXT. GARDEN - DAY
</b>
     CALEB exits the dining area to an area of neat garden,
     looking over the river, and surrounded by the mountain
     ranges.

     The punch bag is suspended by a chain on an exterior flanking
     wall of the house.

     The man working it is wearing shorts, and is shirtless.
     Bathed in sweat.

     His hands are not protected by gloves. Only wraps. Spots of
     blood seep through the pale material around his knuckles.
     This is NATHAN BATEMAN.   He's thirty.

     After a flurry of punches, NATHAN breaks off.

     Breathing hard, he wipes at his eyebrows with the back of his
     wrist. Sweat droplets cascade down his face.

     Then -

     - NATHAN senses the other presence.

     He turns to see CALEB.    Standing by the open glass wall.

     NATHAN walks past CALEB, and goes to a bar area, where there
     is a jug of non-specific vegetable juice waiting, and a
     glass.

CALEB puts his bag down.

<b>                    NATHAN (CONT'D)

NATHAN pours himself a glass of the vegetable juice.

<b>                    NATHAN (CONT'D)

NATHAN laughs.

CALEB feels he needs to say something.

Looking around, he sees a collection of empty beer bottle on
the kitchen counter.

NATHAN doesn't answer.

He's still drinking.

The silence extends a little.   Verges on odd.

NATHAN puts his empty glass down.

CALEB doesn't have time to answer.

NATHAN smiles.

     - what appears to be a neon coloured jellyfish. Tendrils
     like axons, hanging in a black-blue liquid space.

<b>     REVEAL -
</b>
     - the jellyfish is contained in a glass orb.
     Which is held in an exposed cavity at the back of machined
     skull-shape...

     ... which is part of a robot girl.

     Her name is AVA.

     She's an extraordinary piece of engineering.

     Proportioned as a slender female in her twenties, her limbs
     and torso are a mixture of metal and plastic and carbon
     fibre.

     The carbon fibre is charcoal colour. The plastic is cream.
     The metal has the yellow-warmth of nickel.

     The shapes of her body approximate the form of muscle.   There
     are biceps, and breasts. Her hands have five delicate
     digits.

     Her body-structure is covered in a delicate skin. The skin
     is a mesh, in the pattern of a honeycomb. Like a spiderweb,
     it is almost invisible unless side-lit.

     The one part of her that is not obviously an inorganic
     construct is her face - which is that of a strikingly
     beautiful girl. Created in a defined oval, from the top of
     the forehead to just below her chin. Indistinguishable from
     a real girl in its appearance and in the way it moves -
     except for one thing.

     There is a very slight, almost imperceptible blankness in her
     eyes.

As we observe AVA, she fits a section of skull-plate to the
back of her head, which obscures the glass orb and jellyfish
structure.

Then -

- she half turns. As if having become aware of another
presence in the room.

<b>REVEAL -
</b>
- the room in which AVA stands.

AVA'S living area is made up of three primary spaces.

The main area is the OBSERVATION ROOM. A large area,
arranged around a glass box, from which she can be viewed.

At the back of the observation room, behind a sheet of semi-
opaque glass, is the PRIVATE AREA. This contains a bed-like
structure, a desk, a wardrobe, and a mirror.
And behind the private area is the GARDEN AREA. This is a
small decorative indoor garden, lit by lamps. The garden is
sealed off from AVA by a thick wall of glass.

There are also several oval discs positioned around the room,
made of some kind of dark non-reflective material. These are
induction plates.

And there is a chair, which faces the glass observation box.

And facing that chair, inside the observation box, is another
chair.

Beside which, CALEB stands.

A beat -

- as CALEB and AVA see each other for the first time.

Then -

- AVA starts walking. Revealing a secondary impact of her
engineering: how she moves. The unconscious precision of her
steps. The fluidity of her action.

CALEB is transfixed as she covers the length of the room to
her chair.

Then she sits down.

And speaks.

<b>                      AVA
</b>           Hello.
<b>                                                          20.
</b>

Her voice has no digital inflections.    It is just the voice
of a girl.

CALEB gathers himself.

<b>                          CALEB
</b>          ... Hi.

<b>                    AVA
</b>          Who are you?

<b>                          CALEB
</b>          I'm Caleb.

<b>                    AVA
</b>          Hello, Caleb.

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          ... Do you have a name?

<b>                          AVA
</b>          Yes.     Ava.
<b>                    CALEB
</b>          ... I'm pleased to meet you, Ava.

<b>                    AVA
</b>          I'm pleased to meet you too.

CALEB sits opposite her.

He is alone on his half of the glass.    Nathan is nowhere to
be seen.

But on the ceiling, and attached to the walls, on both sides
of the glass, there are several CCTV cameras. Trained
variously on CALEB and AVA. Lenses twitching.

CUT BACK to AVA.

She watches CALEB.    Then cocks her head slightly to the side.

<b>                    AVA (CONT'D)
</b>          Are you nervous?

CALEB frowns.

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          ... Why do you ask that?

A beat.

Then AVA repeats her question.

<b>                    AVA
</b>          Are you nervous?
<b>                                               21.

</b>          Why?

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          I'm not sure.

<b>                    AVA
</b>          I feel nervous too.

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          ... Do you?

<b>                      AVA
</b>          Yes.

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          Why do you feel nervous?

<b>                    AVA
</b>          I've never met anyone new before.
          Only Nathan.

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          ... Then we're both in quite a
          similar position.

<b>                    AVA
</b>          Haven't you met lots of new people
          before?

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          None like you.

<b>                      AVA
</b>          Oh.

Beat.

<b>                      CALEB
</b>          So.    Let's break the ice.

He glances at her.   Observing.

<b>                    CALEB (CONT'D)
</b>          Do you know what I mean by that?

<b>                      AVA
</b>          Yes.

          awkwardness.

Beat.

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          So let's have a conversation. If
          we talk, we'll both relax, and get
          to know each other at the same
          time.

<b>                    AVA
</b>          Okay. What would you like to have
          a conversation about?

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          Why don't we start with you telling
          me something about yourself.

<b>                    AVA
</b>          What would you like to know?

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          Whatever comes into your head.
AVA pauses a moment.

<b>                     AVA
</b>          Well. You already know my name.
          And you can see that I'm a machine.
              (beat)
          Would you like to know how old I
          am?

<b>                       CALEB
</b>          Sure.

<b>                       AVA
</b>          I'm one.

<b>                       AVA
</b>          One.

A beat on CALEB.   Processing.

Her answer feels like the near non-sequitur that typically
betray AI responses.

<b>                    AVA (CONT'D)
</b>          Does that seem young to you?

<b>                     CALEB
</b>          Quite young.
              (beat)
          When did you learn how to speak?

AVA pauses, as if considering this question for the first
time.
<b>                                                         23.
</b>

<b>                    AVA
</b>          I don't think I did learn. I
          always knew how to speak - and
          that's strange, isn't it?

<b>                       CALEB
</b>          Why?

<b>                    AVA
</b>          Because language is something that
          people acquire.

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          Some believe language exists in the
          brain from birth, and what is
          learned is the ability to attach
          words and structure to the latent
          ability.

Beat.

<b>                    CALEB (CONT'D)
</b>          Would you agree?

<b>                    AVA
</b>          ... I don't know.       I have no
          opinion on that.

<b>                    AVA (CONT'D)

CALEB says nothing.

Just watches AVA.    Again, lets the non-sequitur sit.

<b>                    AVA (CONT'D)
</b>          I don't have any of my pictures
          with me now, but I can show you
          them tomorrow.

<b>                    CALEB

          them.

<b>                       AVA

CALEB smiles slightly.

</b>          Yeah.     Definitely.
<b>                                                                24.
</b>

     AVA also smiles.

     And suddenly -

     - there is a strong sense of something very human there.    In
     the way the smile lights up her face.

<b>                           AVA

<b>                    NATHAN
</b>          I just thought - fuck. That's so
          perfect. It's so good for the
          story, when we get to tell it. `I
          turned to Caleb, and he was looking
          back at me. And he said: you're

<b>                    NATHAN
</b>          Whatever it was you said.    I wrote

As a kind of punctuation mark, NATHAN downs the remains of
his beer. Then stands, and gets another from the bar.

<b>                    NATHAN (CONT'D)

NATHAN waves a hand.

<b>                    NATHAN

<b>                     CALEB
</b>           God damn it.

He reaches for the remote control.
<b>CLICK.
</b>
The TV at the foot of the bed switches on, suddenly lighting
up the room with cold TV glow.

CALEB squeezes his eyes shut, momentarily dazzled by the
brightness.

When his eyes open again, instead of seeing a TV station, he
sees a LIVE FEED from a CCTV camera.

It shows the OBSERVATION ROOM.

CALEB sits upright in bed.

<b>                     CALEB (CONT'D)
</b>           ... What the fuck?

AVA is sat at the table.

Drawing.

<b>CUT BETWEEN -
</b>
- CALEB watching AVA.

- and varying CCTV ANGLES of AVA as she draws.

The different TV channels flip between feeds from the various
cameras.

CALEB is transfixed by the imagery.

Her posture. Her legs tucked beneath the chair.   The curve
of the breasts on her synthetic torso.
<b>                                                             29.
</b>

The CCTV images become CALEB'S POV.       The things he is
observing.

CLOSE-UPS of her face.     Her eyes.   Her mouth.

The way she bites her lip in an expression of concentration.
As when she smiled, there is a powerful sense in this tiny
gesture of her feeling sentient and human.

Even more so because her face fills the screen, hiding the
mechanical parts of her form.

Throughout, we never clearly see what AVA is actually
drawing.

<b>END ON -
</b>
CALEB.   Glazed.

Then ABRUPTLY -

- the TV goes dead.
And the digital alarm clock goes dead.

And the windowless room is plunged into total darkness, and
total silence. As if the house had been previously filled
with a soft hum of power, which we were unaware of until it
was gone.

In this, we hear CALEB breathing.

</b>           Power cut.     Back up power
           activated.

Soft emergency lighting comes on.

CALEB hesitates a moment.

Then gets out of bed.

Goes to his bedroom door.

Beside the keycard plate, the LED is red.

He swipes it with his card.

The LED stays red.

     CALEB looks around his windowless room.

     Which suddenly has the quality of a prison cell.

     Beats pass.

     Then -

     - as abruptly as the power went off, it comes back again.

     The emergency lighting goes off, the TV and digital alarm
     clock turn back on.

     Then he tries his card again.

     This time, the LED turns blue, and the door opens.    Revealing
     the GLASS CORRIDOR outside.

     Only one area is properly illuminated: a wall, on which a
     large JACKSON POLLOCK drip painting hangs.

     CALEB walks towards it. Studies the strange strands of
     looping colour for a moment.

     A TELEPHONE, on a low table.

     CALEB walks over to it, with a half glance over his shoulder,
     as if sensing he is doing something that - obscurely - he
     shouldn't.

     Then he picks up the handset.

     It's dead.

He hits some buttons.

It stays dead.

There is a slot by the phone.

CALEB puts two and two together. He reaches into his pocket.
Pulls out his KEYCARD. Puts it in the slot...

... and a light on the handset glows red.

CALEB startles.   Turns.

NATHAN is lying on a sofa. A bottle of Peroni rests on his
stomach. On the carpet beside him are a couple of empties.

</b>          It's okay. I've got an apartment.
          Kind of small. But - it's a five
          minute walk to the office. And a
          five minute walk to the ocean,
          which I like.

          the front that got the worst of it.

A long beat.

A kind of processing pause for AVA.

He hesitates.

</b>           Well, a good friend is -

He breaks off.     Feeling the camera, watching.

darkness.

Then the soft emergency lighting lifts up, and throws the
observation room into a completely different light.

Weirder. Cast from LED strips on the floor, illuminating
CALEB and AVA's faces from below.

In the low light, we see a detail of AVA'S honeycomb skin-
mesh that we were not able to see before.

It glows, soft, like phosphorescence - and this changes the
way we see AVA. Where the mesh is almost invisible in bright
conditions, it is now the dominant describer of her form. So
instead of seeing AVA as a primarily robot structure, we now
see the curves and lines of a naked female body.

- CALEB, glancing round at the door to the room, where the

CALEB frowns.

CALEB turns -

     She looks directly at CALEB, and talks, as if continuing a

     CALEB and NATHAN sit at the dining table.

     Lanterns are laid out across the terrace.

     KYOKO lays out different kinds of salad between them. Each
     is beautifully prepared. Leaves are spread and overlapped
     like fish scales.

     As she does so, she knocks a bottle of wine on the table.

     It tips, and lands on its side, and immediately starts
     emptying. A deep red stain, blossoming across the linen.

CALEB pushes back his chair as the liquid pushes towards him,
then starts to fall to the floor.

          Did it get you?

<b>                     CALEB
</b>          No.   No problem.

CALEB takes his napkin, and leans down to start wiping the
floor.

Then KYOKO appears beside him.

She holds her hand out for the napkin.

Her hand remains outstretched.

CALEB hesitates.   Then hands her the napkin.

KYOKO kneels and starts to wipe the wine off the floor.

She looks up at her name.

          I'm pissed when she's so fucking

KYOKO goes back to cleaning around CALEB'S feet.

CALEB looks visibly uncomfortable.

KYOKO looks over again.

She stands, and leaves.

NATHAN walks to over the bar, where he picks up another
bottle.

<b>                    NATHAN (CONT'D)

          you can't avoid. But actually it's

his own.

</b>          No. The system was supposed to be

          had them all killed.

CALEB shoots a glance at NATHAN.    Confirms: just joking.

NATHAN drains his glass.

Then refills.

CALEB'S glass is still untouched.

CALEB hesitates.

Then answers.   Casual.

</b>          Right. When she threw your line
          back at you. About being

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          It got me thinking. In a way, the
          joke is the best indication of AI
          I've seen in her. It's discretely
          complicated. Kind of non-autistic.

<b>                    NATHAN
</b>          What do you mean?

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          It was a play on words, and a play
          on me. She could only do that with
          an awareness of her own mind, and
          also of awareness of mine.

<b>                         NATHAN
</b>               The power cut. That was the only
               bit I couldn't see. All the
               cameras fail, I lose audio, the

     CALEB catches his own gaze in the mirror.

     Ostensibly to check the other cheek. But actually to have
     shifted his position.

     Very faint.   But definitely there.

     A micro beat.

     CALEB enters a small room with a view over the river and

     It is virtually the only room apart from his own that he
     seems able to gain access to.

     The lights are all off. The room is only lit by the
     moonlight through the sliding glass wall, and lanterns in the
     garden.

     He starts walking towards the glass wall.
     Then stops.

     On the patio, NATHAN is working the punch bag.

     KYOKO stands a few feet away from him, holding a white towel.

     With the glass wall closed, no noise of the impacts
     penetrates into the room.

     CALEB watches.

     NATHAN'S attack on the bag seems strange. More extreme than
     the hard workout we saw the first time he was using the bag.

     This seems brutal.   Almost frenzied.

     For a few moments, the attack on the bag is observed in
     silence, from inside the main room.

     We can only hear the sound of CALEB'S breathing.

As she walks, CALEB reopens his eyes.
Through the semi-opaque dividing glass, he watches her.   The
ghost image.

In the PRIVATE AREA, she opens a wardrobe space, which
reveals clothes, and a hair-piece.

Then she starts to get dressed.

First a summer dress.

Then stockings.

Then a long-sleeved cardigan.

She checks her reflection in the mirror, and adjusts the
clothes slightly. Making sure that as much of her robot form
is covered as possible.

Then she puts on the hair-piece.     Short, brown hair.

Finally, she makes a subtle adjustment to her face. Similar
to putting on make-up, she adjusts the intensity of her own
skin tones. Her lips redden. Her cheeks blush slightly. A
discreet line of black extends like mascara around her eyes.

As she starts to move back towards him, CALEB recloses his
eyes. And keeps them closed, as he hears her approach.

CALEB opens his eyes.

And sees AVA.

Transformed.

By covering the robot form of her chest and arms and legs,
and adding the hairpiece, she has taken a huge visual step
towards appearing human.

     In her room, AVA stands in front of the mirror.

     She is wearing the summer dress she put on earlier.

     Checking her reflection from different angles.

     Subtly girlish.    Unself-conscious.
     Then -

     - she starts to take the dress off.

     Throughout the narrative, we have almost only ever seen AVA
     in an unclothed form. But now - having been clothed - the
     undressing seems to make her naked.

     And the act itself feels charged. Sexualised, in the way the
     clothing is unbuttoned, and dropped, and her shape is
     revealed.

     Finally, once she is completely undressed -

     - AVA turns.     And glances.

     Where AVA and CALEB are sat, either side of the dividing

     NOW REVEAL - one of the other monitor screens.
     It shows an angle on AVA we have not seen before. From this
     viewpoint, we can see something just below the frame of the
     observation window, on AVA'S side of the glass.

     A small induction plate.

     On this angle, we see AVA rest her hand against it.

     At that moment -

     - the screens simultaneously go black.

     All lights die.

     Another POWER CUT.

     In the reflection from the dark monitor screens, we can see
     NATHAN'S face.

     It remains frozen.   Expressionless.

     Then he reaches for his pen.   Jots down a few words on a post-

     Then walks to the wall of notes, and sticks it on.

     - and NATHAN takes a corrective movement step to regain his
     balance. Showing that he is drunk.

     Only now -

     - CALEB turns.

     And freezes.    Seeing the television.

     On the screen, NATHAN reaches down to the table.

     He picks up the drawing AVA was working on, and he looks at
     it for a moment.

     They exchange a few words.

     Then abruptly NATHAN rips drawing in half.      Drops it on the
     floor. Then turns, and exits.

     Leaving AVA alone.

     Standing by the painting, he can see KYOKO.

KYOKO looks at CALEB.

Then, in answer to his question, she reaches up to the top
button of her shirt and pops it open.

CALEB releases her wrist at once.

<b>                    CALEB (CONT'D)
</b>          What the fuck?

She undoes the next button, and pulls open the shirt,
revealing her bare chest.

</b>          Stop!

<b>                    NATHAN

CALEB turns.

NATHAN has entered.

He's holding a drink.   His words are slurred.

<b>                      NATHAN (CONT'D)
</b>          However.

He walks, slightly unsteadily towards a Lutron control panel,
set into the wall.

<b>                    NATHAN (CONT'D)
</b>          You would not be wasting your

His hand hovers uncertainly over the buttons.

<b>                    NATHAN (CONT'D)
</b>          ... if you were dancing with her.

His finger lands.

Immediately, the lighting in the room undergoes a complete
change. Transforming from the discreet and tasteful low
light of evening, into the coloured glows of a night-club.

Simultaneously, from unseen speakers, DANCE MUSIC starts
playing.

CALEB stands - frozen by the surrealism of what has just
happened.

KYOKO starts walking to the center of the room.

And once taken position, she starts dancing.

NATHAN calls to CALEB.

<b>                     NATHAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Go on!   Dance with her.

He gestures at KYOKO.

</b>              (to himself)
          I don't fucking believe this.

NATHAN makes his way to CALEB, and rests a hand on his
shoulder.

</b>          Come on, man! After a hard day of

CALEB raises his voice over the sound of the music.

<b>                    CALEB
</b>          What were you doing with Ava?

NATHAN smiles back at NATHAN, smiling, alcohol-glazed.

</b>          What?

</b>          I'm going to tear up the fucking
          dance floor, dude. Check it out.

NATHAN sets off towards KYOKO.

CALEB watches, amazed, as KYOKO and NATHAN start dancing
together.

Although NATHAN is drunk, they work through the beats of a
routine they have obviously done many times before.

It's just starting to look weirdly impressive -

     - when NATHAN totally loses his balance.

     On his way down, he lands hard on a glass coffee table.

     Looking up at him, the glass frosts.

She walks up to the glass, and holds them up together.

It's the drawing she was doing last light.   The drawing that
NATHAN tore in half.

The drawing is of CALEB.
A simple portrait.    Honest, and accomplished.

She takes down the drawing.

     NATHAN uses the glass wall to support himself.

     He reaches his door.
     Then sticks his hand in his pocket for his KEYCARD.

     But it isn't there.

     He checks his other pocket.

     Suddenly - with both hands in his pockets - he loses balance,
     and crashes to the ground.

     Lands hard.

     Lies there for a moment.

     Groaning.   Blinking.    Catching his breath.

     Then sees the figure of CALEB standing over him.

     picks something up from the floor.

     CALEB looks at her.

     She looks at him.

     Opens his mouth.    Looks inside.

     Feels his wrist for his pulse.

     Feels his skin on the same seam where KYOKO opened herself.

     Pauses.

     Then picks up his disposable plastic razor.

     Forcing it with his hand against the porcelain of the sink.

     Snapping the plastic.

     Places it against his forearm.

     And cuts.

     Blood runs out.

     CALEB watches it.

     Sees the way droplets hit the white sink. The way they
     expand, and merge with existing water droplets.

     Then he switches the tap on, and puts his arm under the flow.

     The water clears away the blood, revealing the cut.

     CALEB pulls open at the slice with his fingers, spreading it.
     Revealing no carbon fibre.   Only muscle.

     He exhales.

     And glances up at the mirror, and his own reflection.

     Then...

     ... reaches up his forearm, and very deliberately wipes blood
     across the glass.

     Then, through the blood, we see him pull his fist back.

      NATHAN and CALEB stand in front of the computer.

      On it, a clip of film is playing.

      It shows the scene that CALEB witnessed two nights before, of
      NATHAN entering AVA'S room, and an exchange between them.
      But whereas the first time the sound was muted, this time we
      can hear the audio.

      NATHAN stands above AVA.   Drunk.

      AVA is sat at the table, with her drawing.
<b>                            NATHAN

</b>                  Yeah. But he doesn't get an audio

                  communicating outside of my line of
                  sight.

      NATHAN reaches over and picks up her picture of CALEB.

<b>                            NATHAN (CONT'D)
</b>                  So all he can see is two people

      A beat.

      He lets the two pieces fall to the floor.

</b>                   ... it allows me to do this.

      ... then FREEZES the film again.

      This time, ON THE SCREEN:

      AVA is reaching for her torn picture.

      And NATHAN is reaching out with his hand.

      And his hand is holding something.

<b>                             NATHAN (CONT'D)
</b>                   Put a new camera in the room.
                   Battery powered, of course.

      NATHAN unfreezes the image.

      And we quite clearly see NATHAN place the object on AVA'S
      bookcase.

      NOTE THAT on the two previous occasions we have seen this
      clip of film, we will have seen him do this action. But not
      register it, instead reading the action as him drunkenly
      using the shelf to steady himself.

      CALEB stares at the monitor for a few moments.

      Then turns.

      He walks towards a chair.    And sits down.

It dazzles him.

NATHAN hesitates.

       He turns.

       The handle of a KITCHEN KNIFE is jutting out of the middle of
       his back, just left of his spine. It has been jammed so deep
       that the tip of the blade has poked out of his chest.

       Blood soaks into his shirt material with amazing speed,
       blossoming from the point of the wound.

       He sees KYOKO.

      He lashes out with the metal bar.

      It catches KYOKO in the jaw.

      Her entire lower jaw snaps off.

      It reveals metal armature, and carbon fibre, and spurting
      pneumatic fluid. And something in her neck, glowing and
      sparking.

      Then she folds down to the ground, as her power abruptly cuts
      out.

      She pulls the knife out of his back.
      Feeling this happen, NATHAN turns -

      - and AVA pushes the knife into his chest.

      NATHAN stares at AVA.

      Then takes a slight step away from her.

      And sits down heavily on the white carpet.

      Crimson drips onto bleached fibre.

      Beats pass on this strange image:

      KYOKO sprawled on the floor with her broken face.

      NATHAN sitting upright, his upper torso now drenched in
      blood.

      AVA standing.   Watching NATHAN.

      After a few moments, NATHAN slumps sideways.

      And stops breathing.

      AVA stands in NATHAN'S BEDROOM, in front of the previous AI
      androids.

      She is unclothed.

      She gazes at the androids.

      Then she removes the arm from JADE, and replaces her own
      shattered limb.

      She takes a moment to see how the new limb looks in the
      mirrors.

      Then she starts removing sections of JADE'S skin.

      And putting it on herself.

      The skin sucks itself to the honeycomb mesh, as if the mesh
      and the underside of the skin are magnetised, attracted to
      each other.

      As a large section of skin is removed from her torso, JADE -
      who has been motionless until now - turns her head slightly
      to look at AVA.

      They exchange a glance.    Locking eyes for a moment.

      The glow of honeycomb mesh vanishes as AVA applies the last

      Nothing of her robot forms remains.

      She closes the door on JADE, and now sees herself in the
