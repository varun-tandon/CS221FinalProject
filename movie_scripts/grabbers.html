          two strangers in an elevator. Lisa sips her coffee. Hates
          it. O'Shea slumps at his desk, throws his feet up and sighs.
                         
          Kenifick barges back in and O'Shea falls over himself to
          straighten up, burning himself with his coffee.

          Lisa stifling a smile. The office phone RINGS and O'Shea
          sluggishly reaches for it. But Lisa beats him to it.

          At the dock PADDY BARRETT sorts his lobster traps.   All he's
          short is a parrot and a wooden leg.
                         
          His traps appear empty, some mangled, but before he can
          protest one of the oblong traps leaps. He watches it and
          like a magic trick it leaps again.
                         
          He squats down and gazes between the seaweed strewn cage.
          Nothing to be seen thanks to the seaweed. He prods it and
          lo, it shifts violently. Hopping mad.
                         
          Paddy rises, wipes his frowning forehead with his cap and
          gestures to a fisherman packing ice crates on the dock.

          Paddy gently kicks the lobster trap, spurring it. On cue, it
          haphazardly jumps across the wet dock. Tadhg snickers.

          something black and slithery crawls up the wall behind him.

          Water drips from the cave walls while the sound of crashing
          waves echoes throughout.
                         
          At the cave mouth, the dregs of a wave wash over Paddy's
          boots. He looks into the cave, anxiously.

          Venturing further into the shadowy cave, Lisa finds an arched
          entrance to the rising ocean as fog creeps around her feet.
                         
          O'Shea rounds some rocks, finding Lisa and seeing her
          flashlight has found a fisherman's shredded slicker. (The

          darts across the metal ladder laid over the pit like a

          The Grabber chokes and spasms.   A monstrous wail and --
                         
          -- O'Shea is flung into the air.

          O'Shea lands.   He spits up dirt as Lisa runs to him.

          She leans in close as if to kiss him. O'Shea puckers up.
          But Lisa grabs the flare gun from his belt and runs back to
          the precipice of the pit.

          She aims it at the oil drums.    The ROAR of the Grabber.

          The shockwave hurtles Lisa onto her arse beside O'Shea.    Both
          laid out in the mud. Grabber gunk and rain pelts them.

          No longer raining, O'Shea and Lisa look absolutely filthy as
          they come walking over the hillside. She hiccups demurely.

          They shuffle on together. Battle-scarred. Limping.   Side-by-
          side. Lisa takes O'Shea's flask from her pocket.

          She hands it to him. O'Shea remembers it for a brief moment,
          then lets it fall away. Lisa smiles. Proud of him.
                         
          They stagger on, the beautiful sea panorama before them.
          Casually they fill the pauses, at ease with the world.

          Lisa absorbs the vista before her.

          O'Shea puts his arm around her, and they seem right together.
