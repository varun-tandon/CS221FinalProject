     Moonlight reflects on a vehicle's shiny surface.  FISTS THUD into
     flesh.  O.S. -- a man slams of the hood, rebounds away.

     BLACK -- MORE TITLES -- then

     LOVERS -- caught in FREEZE-FRAMES of green neon -- off, on, off,
     on -- like a strobe's instant-images -- of gasping, tough sex.

     ON A GLEAMING POOL DECK of black-and-white tile -- two women in

</b>
<b>     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
     A place of money and privilege.  White coral buildings surround
     an open yard.  Tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana
     palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky.

     Beyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the
     waters of Biscayne Bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of
     the school's sailing class bob at their moorings.

     For a moment all is quiet.  Then, faintly, the HUM of many
     VOICES, rising and falling, LAUGHTER.

     The CAMERA PANS to the open windows of a building somewhat larger
     than the others.  The SOUNDS grow louder.

<b>     INT. BLUE BAY AUDITORIUM - DAY
</b>
     A hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage.
     The students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well-tended -- a
     veritable sea of adolescent sexuality -- bronze boys who seem to
     have just come from the boats or tennis courts -- girls in tight
     shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as...

     SAM LOMBARDO strolls out onto the stage.  The man is thirtyish,
     drop-dead handsome.  Dressed not that differently from the kids,
     in an Izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes.

     His entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon
     the girls.

     KAREN and JANELLE, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle.

     NICOLE, a dark-eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches Sam's
     walk, then turns to the girl at her side...

     KELLY VAN RYAN, 17, a fully-developed knockout.

<b>                                  NICOLE
</b>                  When we graduate the only thing I'm
                  going to miss is...
                         (with a nod to the stage)
                  Know what I mean?

     Kelly's eyes are locked on Sam.  Nicole has to nudge her.

<b>                                  NICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>                  Kelly?

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                         (still staring)
                  Oh yeah.

     Sam is at the podium.  He looks out across the audience.  There
     are a couple of flirtatious whistles, laughter.  Sam smiles,
     silencing them with a wave of his hand.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  We've come to the halfway point in my
                  senior seminars...

     Cheers, applause.  Sam waits for the kids to settle.

<b>                                  SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                  Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?

<b>                                  JIMMY (O.S.)
</b>                  No!

     Boos as we FIND...

     JIMMY LEACH, 18, grumge look, long hair.  He sits with a clique
     of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at Blue
     Bay School.  Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does...

     SUZlE TOLLER, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just
     enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a
     loner.  She studies Sam Lombardo with a dark, sullen stare.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Thank you, Jimmy.

<b>                                  JIMMY
</b>                  Hey, man, at least in study hail I could
                  meditate.

<b>                                  KIRK (O.S.)
</b>                  He means masturbate...

     This remark is greeted by a chorus of laughter as we FIND...

     KIRK, one of the golden boys, seated with Kelly and Nicole.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Something Kirk with which I'm sure you
                  have hands-on experience.

     Loud laughter.  Sam quiets them again, then turns to the
     blackboard, where he begins to write, in big letters -- S-E-X.
     The kids start to cheer.

     Sam writes another word -- C-R-I-M-E-S.

     The cheering fades into silence.

<b>                                  SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                  We've all heard the words, date rape,
                  sexual harassment.  We've talked about
                  some of these things in this room.
                         (beat)
                  Our speakers today head up the Blue Bay
                  Police Sex Crimes Unit -- Detectives Ray
                  Duquette and Gloria Perez.
                         (beat)
                  They're here to give you what we hope
                  will be a fresh perspective on these
                  subjects, and to answer any questions
                  you night have.

     Sam turns to the wings, his hand out to welcome the visitors...

     RAY DUQUETTE, mid-thirties, with the lanky build of a light
     heavyweight, walks out onto the stage.  He's dressed in a dark
     suit, dark hair combed straight back above steel-rimmed glasses.

     GLORIA PEREZ walks at his side.  She's a good six inches shorter
     than Ray, with a sweet face.  Attractive but no stunner.

     About five kids applaud.  Ray takes the podium.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  Thank you for having us.  We'll each
                  talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then
                  open it up to your questions...

<b>     IN THE AUDIENCE
</b>
     Suzie Toller suddenly gets to her feet.  As she passes behind
     Jimmy, we HEAR her VOICE, beneath her breath.

<b>                                  SUZIE
</b>                  I'm not going to listen to this
                  jack-off.

     She marches down the aisle and bangs out the rear door..

     Ray pauses, a dark look on his face, then goes on...

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  Let's begin with a question.  What is a
                  sex crime?

     A moment.

<b>                                  JIMMY
</b>                  Not getting any.

     This draws a few laughs from the kids, a couple of thin smiles
     from Sam and Gloria.  And none at all from Ray Duquette.

<b>     EXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</b>
     The kids change classes.  Sam, Ray and Gloria CROSS the grass.
     The kids swarm past.  A pair of girls flash by.

<b>                                  CAROLE
</b>                  Have a nice weekend, Mr. Lombardo.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>
                  Hey, Carole, you too.  And be good.

<b>                                  CAROLE
</b>                         (beneath a pouty look)
                  I hate to be good.

     The three adults ENTER an old wooden building.

<b>     INT. BUILDING - DAY
</b>
<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  This is one of the original buildings.
                  We have the offices here now.

     The walls are paneled in wood, decorated with framed photographs.
     Gloria stops before one of the photos.

<b>     ANGLE ON PHOTOGRAPH
</b>
     An old black-and-white, with that sepia caste harkening back to
     another age.

     A handsome young man of perhaps 14 stands at the helm of a boat
     under sail.  His hair is swept back, his eyes fixed upon an
     unseen horizon.  There is something in this boy's pose, in the
     line of his jaw, in the clarity of his gaze, as if what he has
     fixed upon is the future itself.

<b>                                  GLORIA
</b>                  Anybody in particular?

     When no one answers, she turns to find Sam at her side.  He
     stares at the picture, then looks at Gloria.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Sam Lombardo.  The first.  Class of
                  'Forty-Two
                         (beat)
                  My father.

     Gloria does a slow double-take, looking from Sam to the photo and
     back again.

<b>                                  VOICE (0.S.)
</b>                  Can't seem to get rid of the Lombardos
                  around here.

     Sam and the detectives turn as a professorial-looking guy in a
     baggy brown suit (ART MADDOX) arrives on the scene.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Art.  Say hello to Detectives Perez and
                  Duquette.
                         (to the cops)
                  Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor.

     Art and the detectives shake hands.

<b>                                  ART
</b>                  So, did you set 'em all straight on the
                  ugly facts of life?

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  I have the feeling, they got it down
                  already.  They're a step ahead of us,
                  Artie.

     Gloria seems to find this amusing.  Ray stands at her side, looks
     at Sam.  Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at
     which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  I've got that two o'clock in town.

<b>                                  GLORIA
</b>                         (nodding)
                  Back to the land of grownups.

     The detectives shake hands once more with San and Art.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                         (to Gloria)
                  If old pictures interest you, come back
                  some time, there's quite a collection
                  down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a
                  proper tour.

<b>                                  GLORIA
</b>                         (smiling)
                  I'd like that.

     Ray opens a door for her.  The detectives pass through it.

     Art claps Sam on the shoulder, then walks off down the hallway.
     Sam remains near the doors, watching as...

<b>     ANGLE ON THE DRIVE LEADING TO THE SCHOOL
</b>
     Ray and Gloria walk past half a dozen expensive cars -- Range
     Rovers, Beamers and Mercedes, to a plain, white Ford Taurus,
     which they get into and drive away.

<b>     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - LATER
</b>
     Cheerleaders perform a sensual dance on the porch of a wooden
     pagoda.  A rugby team runs drills on the grass, as out on the
     bay, six tiny racing sloops tack toward the docks.

<b>     ANGLE ON DOCKS
</b>
     As the sloops enter the narrow channel between the slips one
     student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets
     about tying off the boat.

     Sam is on one of the boats.  Jimmy Leach is at the rudder.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                         (loud enough to be heard
                          by his class)
                  Okay, you guys.  Good work.  Now coil
                  those dock lines and I'll see you all on
                  Monday.

     He watches his class clamber up the docks.  His eye falls upon
     the pagoda, the dancing cheerleaders -- Kelly Van Ryan in
     work-out tights -- bare arms reaching for the sky.

<b>     EXT. SCHOOL DOCKS - SAM &amp; JIMMY - LATER
</b>
     hosing down boats, stowing sails.  They look up as...
     A HUGE POWER BOAT glides past.  The docks rock in its wake.

<b>                                  JIMMY
</b>                  All right.  I could party on that.

     Sam just laughs at him.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  That's about all it's good for.
                         (beat)
                  That's the one to have.

     He points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the
     bay, under sail.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  The Windward Passage.  I crewed on that
                  one summer.
                         (beat)
                  Long time ago.

     He pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line.

<b>                                  JIMMY
</b>                  You know, I want to thank you for
                  getting me into this class...  No way was
                  my old man going to spring for the
                  fees...

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Hey, you're working for it.
                         (beneath a laugh)
                  Least you're supposed to be.

     He tosses Jimmy the coiled line.  Jimmy's caught off-guard, but
     catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam.

<b>                                  VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                  Can I play too?  Or is it just for boys?

     Sam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the
     dock.  She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse
     knotted at the bottom to REVEAL a flat, tanned stomach; open at
     the top to REVEAL the swelling of her breasts.  She favors Sam
     with a coy smile.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  So who's washing your car this weekend,
                  Mr. Lombardo?
                         (off Sam's blank look)
                  The senior car wash, remember?
                         (beat)
                  Tamara's making a schedule.  She said
                  you bought a coupon but you're not on
                  anybody's list.

     Sam smiles, remembering.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Well, you know.  Figured I'd buy a
                  Washing ticket, support the effort.
                  That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste
                  of time, don't you think?

     Sam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the
     dock, Jimmy at his side.  Kelly falls in with then.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Not at all.  How about if Nicole and I
                  do it?  We're working as a team.

     Sam just looks at her.  She looks back -- big, pleading eyes.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out
                  to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys
                  can wash the mud off.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Deal.
                         (beat)
                  You know, I just looked out front.  My
                  ride wasn't there.  You suppose you
                  could give me one?

     Sam doesn't answer right away.  He looks toward the school.

<b>                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                  You wouldn't want me to walk, would you?
                  I mean like, something bad might happen.

     Sam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who
     seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?

<b>                                  JIMMY
</b>                         (still looking at Kelly)
                  What?

<b>                                  SAM

<b>                                 JIMMY
</b>                  Yeah.  But I got my bike.

<b>     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
     Sam's Jeep rolls out of the drive, Jimmy's bike in back, meaning
     that Jimmy and Kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which
     is fine with Jimmy.  Kelly's thigh is pressed against his.  His
     arm pushes against her breast.  Kelly is not so happy.

     As they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat-to-shit
     VW bug -- stalled at a stop sign.

     A John Deere tractor mower sits nearby.  A groundsman -- a tall
     black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as...

     Suzie Toller -- in black platform shoes, a T-shirt and cutoff
     jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage.

     Sam pulls up next to the bug and stops.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  We got room for one more, Suzie.  You
                  need a ride?

     Kelly rolls her eyes as Suzie turns to look at them.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Jesus.  Where'd she get those shoes?
                  Whores-4-Less?

     Suzie's eyes go cold.  She signals the groundsman, who turns the
     key.  The CAR SPLUTTERS to life.  Suzie flashes a smile, then
     sticks out her tongue -- which has been pierced by a silver stud.

<b>                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                  That's cute.

     Suzie gives her the finger.  Sam makes eye contact with Suzie,
     offers a sad smile, while putting the Jeep in gear.

<b>                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                         (to Suzie)
                  I hope you swallow it.

     Jimmy turns, waving to Suzie as the Jeep pulls away.

<b>     EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</b>
     Magnificent old mansions occupy five-acre bay-front parcels amid
     lush, tropical settings.

     Sam's Jeep stops before a pair of gates with the words "VAN RYAN"
     woven into their wrought-iron design.  Beyond the gates a long
     drive leads toward a huge stone house.  Kelly jumps out, punches
     in a code.  The gates swing open.

<b>                                  KELLY

     SANDRA VAN RYAN, Kelly's mom, big, sexy, aggressive, a young 42
     in a string bikini, comes out from the side of the house.  When
     she sees the Jeep, she starts down the drive.

     Kelly waves to Sam, then walks up the drive.  When she sees her
     mother coming toward her, her face hardens.

<b>                                  SANDRA

     Sandra comes through the gate and up to the Jeep.

     Jimmy is checking her out.  All eyes.

                  What?  You're going to drive off without

     Sandra looks down her nose at Jimmy.

<b>                                  SANDRA
</b>                  He can wait.

     Sam glances past her, to Kelly, who stands languidly at the front
     of the house, watching.

<b>                                  SAM

<b>                                  SANDRA

     Sandra gives him a hard stare, then marches off toward the house.

     Neat little stucco houses -- some not so neat -- simmer in
     tropical heat.

     A BMW Z-3 Roadster stops at the head of the cul-de-sac.  Nicole
     is driving.  Kelly sits beside her.

     a guy mowing his yard.

     Nicole does, before one of the not-so-neat houses.  Sam's muddy
     Jeep Wrangler is parked in the drive.  Behind that is a red
     Mercedes convertible.

<b>     INT. SAM'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME
</b>
     Sam and BARBARA, 28, a lean, beautiful country-clubber roll on
     the bed.  Barbara is dressed for tennis.  Sam wears a baggy pair
     of khaki shorts.  Barbara struggles to escape.  Sam grabs a leg,
     kisses the back of her knee.

     He pushes up the little white skirt, kissing her between her
     thighs.

     Barbara starts to giggle.  He's just about got her when...

     The DOORBELL RINGS.  Sam lets go.  Barbara sighs.

<b>     INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

     Sam goes to the front door, opens it, to find...

     Kelly and Nicole, holding plastic pails full of rags.  The girls
     are dressed in Blue Bay High T-shirts, cropped to REVEAL flat
     tummies, shorts and running shoes.

     As Barbara goes to her car she sees the girls coming from behind

     waves.

     Kelly and Nicole, looking very much like the finalists in a wet
     T-shirt derby, ring the bell.

     Sam answers.  He looks them over.  A couple of houses down he can
     see the guy with the mower, dumping grass into a can, watching
     the girls, then turning to walk back to his house.

     Sam ENTERS the room to find Kelly just inside the doorway, where
     the water from her wet clothing has formed little pools on the

     closer, allowing the door to SWING shut behind her.

     There are tears on her face.  As she hits the street, she begins
     to run.

     The man with the mower is now seated on his parch, drinking beer.
     He watches as the girl runs by.

     The teenagers are still playing hoops.  They stop as Kelly jogs

     Sam, perched in the pilot's seat of a beat-to-shit old air boat,
     rips through the Florida swamp land.

     He glides across channels of water, then turns into the tall
     grass which whips at the hull of his boat.  Bits and pieces of
     debris fly through the air.  Sam smiles, swinging the boat
     through a series of wide, sliding turns.

     Suddenly he spots something.  He throttles down gliding into a
     shallow pool where... A HUGE ALLIGATOR, aware it has been found
     out, whips about, stirring up mud, then scuttling OUT OF SIGHT

     binoculars from beneath his seat and looks through them.

<b>     ANGLE ON HORIZON

     All we SEE is a shabby collection of whitewashed buildings
     shimmering in the last long light of afternoon.

     revs up his engine and leaves.

     primordial intelligence, gazing out, unblinking across the murky
     waters of the swamp.

<b>     EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     muddy once more.  So is Sam.  He gets out.

     walks across the room and into the bathroom.

     Clouded mirrors, a shower stall full of. steam.  Behind the glass
     door we SEE an indistinct shape, moving about in the hot water.

     She grabs his shirt, pulling him into the shower's flow.  They
     kiss.  She pulls his shirt open, loosens his pants.  His clothes
     fall away.  Sam pushes her up against the tile wall, hard.  She
     holds to his shoulders, nails sinking into his flesh, wrapping
     her legs around his hips as...

     The water, dark with swamp mud, spirals down the drain.

     the gun, pointing at the yellow window.

     her head back -- an explosion of hair -- gasps -- an orgasm is

     phone once more, punching in a number.

     Desk, files, a terrarium full of swamp lizards, above which a
     photo of the Windward Passage decorates the wall.  There's a
     Waterford bowl on the desk -- etched with "Sam Lombardo -- Blue
     Bay Educator of the Year."

     Sam is working on the computer.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers.

     In his office, Sam pushes himself away from the computer,
     stiffening noticeably.

</b>                  To tell you the truth, I haven't seen
                  her since Friday.

     BOOM -- A SHOTGUN BLASTS outside Sandra's window.  She jumps.
     BOOM, BOOM -- more BLASTS.  She jumps up to look outside.

                  I haven't found anyone else can handle

     She glances at Frankie -- who has heard enough.  He gives her a
     long hard look, then rolls from the bed to walk from the room.

     Sam remains silent, watching the lizards with their blank,
     unblinking eyes.

</b>                  Goodbye, Sandra.

     Sam puts down the phone, looks at it -- a long moment as -- the
     barest hint of a smile plays upon his face.

     Sandra slams down her phone.  She looks to the bay, to the sleek
     racing sloop floating beyond the private dock.

     The SHOTGUN BLASTS away.  Kelly pauses to reload.  She catches
     sight of...

     Sandra, approaching from the main house.

<b>                                  SANDRA
</b>                  You seem to find guns therapeutic.
                  Maybe I oughta try it.

     Kelly lets the gun's barrel drift over Sandra, then turns to walk
     away.  She moves toward the guest house.  A used-brick cottage
     tucked among the gnarled branches and roots of a huge banyan
     tree.  Sandra follows.

<b>                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
</b>                  Let me guess, some boy didn't call and
                  screwed up the weekend.  So you're
                  taking the day off.

     Kelly looks toward the main house, in time to see...

     Frankie walk from the bedroom and dive into the pool.

<b>                                  SANDRA

     Kelly turns away, starts for the guest house once more.

<b>     INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY

     PAN to REVEAL room -- the gun case, the animal trophies, the
     photos -- One of a stately old gentleman in an elaborate wicker
     chair, a cane at his side, a bowler on his knee.  Others of Kelly
     and a handsome middle-aged man in safari gear, posing with their
     rifles above slain wildebeests and bison.

     Sandra and Kelly ENTER.  Kelly puts down the shotgun, turns,
     tears in her eyes.

<b>                                  SANDRA

     Kelly does a three-sixty, like a model on a runway.

</b>                  My friends buy me clothes, so I don't

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  No thanks to you.

     She sits on the bed.  Sandra moves to stand over her, angry now.

<b>                                  SANDRA
</b>                  Come off of it.

                  I'm trying to spare you that.

     Kelly goes to one shoulder on the bed, sobbing now.  Her mother
     continues to stand over her, suddenly more perplexed than angry.

<b>                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)

</b>                  He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.
                  He could have gone out and gotten a job.
                  Christ, he could've found another rich
                  woman... He never had a problem tucking
                  my friends when we were married.

     She pauses as Kelly cries all the harder.

<b>                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
</b>                  I don't know why he did it.  I really
                  don't...

     Her voice trails away, as meanwhile Kelly has drawn herself up
     into a fetal position on the bed.  The sobbing has stopped but
     her shoulders continue to shake.  Sandra sits on the edge of the
     bed, reaches over to rub Kelly's back.

<b>                                  SANDRA (CONT'D)
</b>                  Can I get you anything?

     Kelly shakes her head, no.

     Her mother looks at her, clearly at a loss.  At last she stands.
     She is headed out of the room when Kelly says something, but the
     words are indistinct, as her fists are pressed against her mouth.

<b>                                  SANDRA
</b>                  What, honey?  I can't hear you.

     There is a long beat as Kelly collects herself.  She stares at
     the wall, her eyes filled with tears, but when she speaks she
     enunciates each word.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  I said.  I was raped.

     Sandra looks as if she has been struck.

<b>                                  SANDRA
</b>                  What?

                  By Sam Lombardo.

     Sandra moves over to the bed, sits once more.

<b>                                  SANDRA
</b>                  He... Sam Lombardo?

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Yes.  God, Mom...

     Kelly begins to cry.  Sandra pulls her upright, cradling her in
     her arms, eyes on fire.

     Sandra slams a fist on the conference table.

     Kelly is seated between her mother and her mother's attorney, TOM
     BAXTER.  Baxter sports an Italian suit and a lethal Alexander
     Haig look.

     Seated across from these three are Ray, Gloria and BRYCE HUNTER,
     the local D.A.

     Silence follows Sandra's outburst.  Baxter reaches to squeeze
     Sandra's shoulder.  Kelly puts her face in her hands.

     slightly stunned.

     Tom Baxter takes her by the arm as Ray CROSSES the room to open
     the door.  Bryce Hunter walks out with then.

     Gloria takes a seat closer to Kelly.  When she speaks, she is
     very calm and quiet.

     Sam sits at his desk, toying with a pencil.  He watches students
     pass -- no smiles, no waves, an occasional dark look.

     Through the press of students Sam sees Art at the door of his
     office.  The two men look at one another.  At which point...

     Gloria, followed by Ray, steps INTO SCENE.  The detectives shake
     hands with Art.  As Art turns to close the door, Sam falls within
     his line of vision.  Art looks away.  The door swings shut.

<b>     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL DOCKS - LATER

     The sky has begun to color.  Art Maddox stands on the grass at
     the end of the channel separating the slips, watching as...

     A lone sailboat tacks toward the school.

<b>     ANGLE ON BOAT - SAM &amp; JIMMY

     Sam drops his sail, leaving himself just enough momentum to
     cruise expertly into the little channel then into the slip.

     Art watches as Jimmy jumps from the boat, ties it off.

     Sam sits in a cramped waiting room, leafing through a magazine.

     An attractive young SECRETARY sits a few feet away, behind her
     desk.  Her PHONE RINGS.  She picks it up, then turns to Sam,
     favoring him with a flirtatious smile.

<b>     EXT. A BLUE HAY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
     Trendy nouveau.  A valet parks Sam's Jeep.

<b>     INT. RESTAURLNT - SAME

     Sam walks across a tiled entry.  He looks tired, but smiles at
     the maitre d'.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Georgie, hey.  I'm meeting Barbara.  She
                  here yet?

     GEORGE looks stiff, maybe a little nervous.  Sam picks up on it.
     He scans the room...

<b>     ANGLE ON ROOM
</b>
     Dimly-lit, crowded, but we PICK OUT Barbara, stunning in a
     delicate white sun dress, tanned arms resting upon a table.

     Sam starts toward her.  George reaches out to touch his arm.

<b>                                  GEORGE
</b>                  Mr. Lombardo.

     Sam ignores him, threading his way among the people at a lavish
     bar, then stopping short as he sees who Barbara is with -- her
     father, Tom Baxter.

     Tom Baxter sees Sam, gets to his feet.

<b>                                  BAXTER
</b>                  This is not appropriate Lombardo.

     Sam steps to one side, makes eye contact with Barbara.

     Barbara has tears in her eyes.  She looks at Sam, then shakes her
     head, looking away.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Barbara...

<b>                                  BAZTER

                  You've been scratching at the door long
                  enough...
                         (as Sam faces him)
                  I ever see you around my daughter,
                  you're going to be finished, period.

     The two men square off, but already we can SEE Georgie, trailed
     by a pair of beefy characters in blue blazers making their way
     across the room.

     Sam sees them too.  He takes a final look at Barbara.  When she
     refuses to meet his eye, he pushes past Baxter, through the crowd
     and out of the restaurant.

<b>     EXT. AN EVERGLADES ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Red neon identifies it as Jim's Recovery Room.  A handful of
     trucks sit in a dirt parking lot, Sam's Jeep among them.

<b>     INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     The air is thick with smoke.  Locals shoot pool.  The walls are
     decorated with dusty fishing nets and inflated blowfish.

     An aging BARMAID -- good-looking -- once, runs a rag around a
     pitcher, looks down the bar, smiles, finding...

     Sam, alone, awaiting service.

<b>                                  BARMAID

                  while.  How's life treatin' you?
                         (off Sam's look)
                  That bad, huh?  Well, you came to the
                  right place.

<b>     EXT. ROADHOUSE - LATER
</b>
     Sam walks outside.  He stands in the red glow of neon light,
     looking toward the road... On the opposite side of which...

     ... sits a sorry little collection of whitewashed stucco
     bungalows, identified by a green neon sign as the Glades Motel.

     Beyond the motel are the Everglades, a great expanse of darkness.

     Sam stares at the motel.  At last he gets in his Jeep.  As he
     EXITS the lot, a second pair of headlights flashes on.

<b>     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT
</b>
     A deserted two-lane road cuts through the swamp.  Trees bearded
     with moss appear as ghostly shapes in the lights of Sam's Jeep.

<b>     INT./EXT. SAM'S JEEP - MOVING - SAME
</b>
     San drives -- a tired face.  Soft MUSIC on the RADIO.

     Something APPEARS in the road, caught for a moment in the
     headlights.  Sam swerves, whirls his head around, sees...

     A GATOR sliding of the shoulder and into the murky water.

     Sam lets out some air, relaxing a bit, then catches sight of
     something else -- Headlights finding reflection in his rearview
     mirror, coming fast.  Sam watches as the lights get closer.  He
     looks back to the road -- an approaching curve...

     Sam is into the curve when the lights catch him.  A black Range
     Rover moves out to pass, then turns suddenly into Sam's lane,
     cutting him off.

     It happens quickly.  Sam swerves to avoid hitting the larger car,
     but the road affords little margin for error.

     The JEEP slides across a narrow shoulder, then plummets down a
     steep embankment, CRASHING through cattails, rolling over to SLAM
     BACK DOWN on its tires in a swampy gulch.

     Sam slumps back from the steering wheel.  Somewhere over his head
     he can see headlights shining into the trees.

     He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM, the SOUNDS of someone scrambling down
     the embankment.

     Sam tries to get out of his seat harness.  Someone is
     approaching, splashing through the muck.  Suddenly a hand reaches
     through the broken driver's window, helping him.

</b>                  Are you all right?

     The hands get him loose.  Sam stumbles from the car.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Yeah, I'm okay.

     He looks up to find -- Frankie Condo, looming over him.

<b>                                  FRANKIE
</b>                  That's too bad.

     He grabs Sam, pulling him OUT OF FRAME.  What we are left with is
     the SOUND of FISTS THUDDING INTO FLESH -- then Sam, hitting the
     hood of his Jeep, slumping down into the muck.

     Frankie is breathing hard.  We HEAR him SLOGGING back up the
     embankment.  We HEAR a DOOR SLAM, the RANGE ROVER driving away,
     leaving only darkness, and the EERIE SOUNDS of the swamp.

     Dazzling light.  Sam's smashed-up Jeep is parked before Ken
     Bowden's office, next door to the Mongolian Beef Bowl.

     Sam and Ken eye one another over a green plastic table -- Ken
     with his neck brace, Sam with a bruised face.

<b>                                  KEN
</b>                  I figured, you know, it would be darker
                  in here.

     He moves a hand to his face.

<b>                                  SAM

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Forget it.

<b>                                  KEN
</b>                  Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all
                  I'm saying.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I
                  thought I might be able to save my
                  fucking house with an equity loan.
                  Guess who's on the board of directors at
                  the bank?

     He pauses to look at Ken Bowden.

                  for lunch sometimes.

     San sighs, slumps back in his plastic seat.

<b>                                  KEN (CONT'D)
</b>                  You're not in bad shape, really.  I know

     Ken reaches into his briefcase.  He pulls out some papers, tosses
     them on the table.  Sam picks one up, starts to read.

<b>     INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Everyone's looking a little tired, with the possible exception of
     Ray.  At this moment he sits back in his chair, staring at Sam.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  Why don't you tell us one more time, how
                  Kelly came to be with you, alone in your
                  house.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                         (with growing impatience)
                  Story's the same, Detective...

     Ken pats him on the arm.  When Sam speaks again, it is in a
     calmer voice, calm but tired.

<b>                                  SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                  I had to go look for this coupon.

<b>                                  RAY

                  Like I said, I hadn't really expected to

                         (beat)
                  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I
                  hear a car.  I look out the window.  I
                  see Nicole driving away.  I leave my
                  room, and there's Kelly.

<b>                                  RAY

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Yes.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  And she wanted to talk.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Yes.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  But you can't tell us what she wanted to
                  talk about.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  I could, but it's confidential.  Look,
                  the point is, we didn't talk.  I told
                  her this was not an appropriate time or
                  place.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  And she began to cry.  And you put an
                  arm around her.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the
                  door.  I told her we would talk on
                  Monday, in the office.

                  where did you expect her to go, without
                  a car?

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Again.  I think we covered this.  I told
                  her I was going to call a cab.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  But she ran away.

                  her...?

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  There's a strip mall not half a mile
                  from my house.  There's phones there.  I
                  cruised the place, but I didn't see her.
                  I figured she was probably there but
                  that she was angry and didn't want to be
                  found.  I don't know... Maybe I should
                  have called.  But it's not like Kelly
                  can't take care of herself.  I figured
                  we'd just take it up on Monday, in the
                  office.

     There is a moment of silence in the room.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  But you do admit to touching her, to
                  putting your arm around her.  Isn't that
                  against the rules?

<b>                                  SAM

     He is cut short as Sam shoves his chair back from the table.

<b>                                  SAM

</b>                  All right, all right... Enough.

     Ken stands up.  He walks to the two-way mirror set in one wall,
     rapping on the glass with his knuckles.

                  Let's go.

     Ken opens the door.  Sam turns back to Ray and Gloria.

<b>                                  SAM

                  working with kids.  I love what I do,

                         (beat)
                  These kids trust me, and there is no

                  that trust.

     As Ken and Sam leave, Ray and Gloria are joined by Bryce Hunter.

                  catch up with her.  I mean how long does

     At which point, a COP APPEARS in the doorway.

     up, rests her head back in the chair, blowing smoke at the
     ceiling.

<b>     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER

     Gloria is grinding out the butt as Ray walks back in.  There is
     something in the way he carries himself, some sense of urgency.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                         (off Gloria's look)
                  Seen any good gator wrestling lately?

<b>     EXT./INT. DETECTIVES' CAR - MOVING - DAY

     Ray and Gloria drive through the Everglades, past marshlands
     punctuated by thick stands of melaluca trees.

<b>                                  GLORIA

                  sucking up water.  And now they can't

                  imagine he gives a shit now.

     Gloria just looks at him.  Ray stares into the dusty light of an
     approaching sunset.  At last he slows, turning off the highway
     and onto a narrow dirt road.

     A sign pokes out from the tall grass -- "SMILIN' JACK'S FISH
<b>     CAMP."

     The Taurus bounces along the washboard road.

     They are driving now at the edge of a canal.

     Ray gives her a look.  Gloria shrugs.

<b>                                  GLORIA (CONT'D)
</b>                  That's what they called it when I was in
                  Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  It's a shithole.  But she was dirty,
                  what was I gonna do?

     They pass a sagging chain-link fence, entering a quarter-mile run
     of shabby trailers and cheap shacks.

     The squalor of the buildings is seat in contrast to the beauty of
     the Glades where the waters have gone to the color of polished
     brass beneath an immense, darkening sky.

     Ray parks before a ramshackle building covered in vines and
     peeling paint.  A sign reads:  "NIGHT CRAWLERS $1 A BUCKET."  The
     jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves.

     As they get out of the car, something catches Gloria's eye --
     along the bank of the canal...

<b>     ANGLE ON BANK
</b>
     where a tall man (WALTER) with long white hair and tattooed arms
     kneels inside a pen, slapping a huge gator on its snout.  The
     reptile lifts its upper body, hissing, opening its jaws.

     Walter takes a stick from his hip pocket, passing it through the
     gator's mouth.  The jaws snap shut, incredibly fast, with a
     hollow snapping sound.

     Gloria jumps instinctively, then watches, aghast, as Walter slaps
     the creature once more.  This time moving round to the front of
     the gator, sticking halt his arm inside its mouth.

<b>                                  VOICE (0.5.)
</b>                  He's just showin' off for you now.

     Gloria starts, then turns to find a woman (RUBY) has walked up
     beside her.  The woman is in her sixties.  She's dressed in
     polyester.  Her hair is piled on top of her head -- too dark to
     be anything but a dye job.  A cigarette bobs from her lips.

     Before Gloria can respond, Ray steps up behind than.

<b>                                  RAY

                  I see you still got Walter.  I was sort
                  of hoping something had eaten him by

<b>                                  RUBY
</b>                         (a long beat)
                  Can I help you with something?

     Ray and the old lady look at each other.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  Suzie called.  You know where we can
                  find her?

     Ruby looks toward the store.

<b>                                  RUBY
</b>                  You know the way.

     She watches as the detectives CROSS the road, then calls to them
     as they start up the steps.

<b>                                  RUBY (CONT'D)
</b>                  You won't shoot her will you?  I don't
                  believe she's armed.

     Gloria turns, surprised.  Ray gives the woman a long, cold stare,
     then opens the door for Gloria.

<b>     INT. CAMP STORE - SAME
</b>
     It's dark inside.  The main light source is a tiny, beat-up
     black-and-white TV.

     Two elderly women in colored bouffant hairdos sit on a ratty old
     couch watching reruns of "Family Feud."  They look up as Ray and
     Gloria ENTER then EXIT through a door in the back.

<b>     INT. SUZIE'S ROOM - SAME
</b>
     Black walls.  Cheap bookshelves, filled to overflowing.  A wire
     strung with dismembered doll parts runs the length of the room.

     Suzie is propped on a ratty futon, an open book on her stomach,
     her thin, white arms crossed behind her head.

<b>                                  SUZIE

                         (beat)
                  I mean, you guys are Sex Crimes.

     Ray manages a thin smile.

                  could meet.  But hi, Suzie.

     Gloria puts out a hand.  Suzie looks at it, puts out a hand of
     her own.

     As the women shake, Gloria looks at the book on Suzie's stomach,
     turning her head as if to read the title.

<b>                                  SUZIE

     Suzie takes a cigarette from a pack at her side, lights up, blows
     smoke at the ceiling.

<b>                                  SUZIE

                  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo
                  gave you the ride?

     Suzie stares at the camera.  She's lost the cockiness she had on
     her own turf.  She looks small, white and frail in the sterile
     room, surrounded by the detectives.

                  That's all.  Let me go.

     Gloria gets to her feet as well; she tries to put an arm around
     Suzie.  The girl jumps back as if she has been shocked.

     Gloria's hands fall to her sides.

     Suzie heads for the door.


     The detectives exchange looks.

     Suzie shoots them a nervous glance, drops her cigarette, bends to
     pick it up, burns her fingers, drops it again.  She curses
     beneath her breath, wrapping her fingers about her shoulders.

     Ray and Gloria watch her, exchange glances.  Gloria picks up

     Hunter is on the witness stand.

     water from one of the tables and hurls it toward the witness
     stand before the bailiff can pin her arms against her sides.

<b>     INT. COURTHOUSE LOBBY - LATER

     A mob scene.  Video crews are herded to one side by bailiffs as
     Sandra and Baxter, with Kelly in tow, move toward a side door.

     Sam and Ken round a corner, followed by Ray and Gloria who walk
     on either side of Suzie.

     Kelly sees them.  She makes a run at Suzie.  For a moment the
     girls shove and kick but Ray and Gloria are between them in a
     hurry, pulling then apart as Baxter arrives to take charge of
     Kelly, pulling her toward the door.

     Ruby and Walter arrive now too.  Suzie runs to them and they lead
     her through the crowd, Walter pushing people aside with his long,
     tattooed arms.

     Gloria heaves a sigh.  Ray pushes a hand through his hair, then
     turns to find Sam looking at him.  Most of the press have run off
     to follow the girls -- looking for more action.  It is a quiet
     moment.  The two men lock eyes.

     Sam leans back, enjoying the silence.  He reaches into a cooler,
     takes out a beer, opens it, takes a drink, then pulls something
     else from the cooler --

     -- a bundle of white butcher's paper.  Sam opens the paper, takes
     out raw meat -- something disgusting to look at -- big red turkey
     necks, maybe, which he tosses into the water.

                  all the way to the bank.

<b>     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
     A hot morning in June.  Shadows angle across the campus.

     Students line up at the old wooden pagoda, picking up caps and
     gowns.  A few turn, surprised to see...

     SAM LOMBARDO cross the parking lot, ENTERS a building.

<b>     INT. ART'S OFFICE - ART
</b>
     working at his desk.  Sam's terrarium is behind him, his
     "Educator of the Year" Waterford bowl, a storage box of files.

     Art looks up at a KNOCK on the DOOR.  Sam walks into the room.
     It is a slightly awkward moment.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Lizards don't seem to miss me.

     The two men smile, breaking the tension.

<b>                                  SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                  How you doing, Artie?

<b>                                  ART
</b>                  I... You know... I...

     Sam waves him off.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Take care of my lizards, Art.

     Art stands up.  The two men shake hands.

<b>     OUTSIDE GUIDANCE OFFICE
</b>
     Sam comes out, then stops suddenly.

     Kelly waits for him.  Kirk and Nicole are with her.  A long
     moment.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Kelly...

<b>                                  KELLY

                  trying to get the money to pay you off?
                  She's trying to break my trust.  How do
                  you like that?  I can't touch it until
                  she's dead and she won't give me a dime
                  and now she's trying to break it to pay
                  you...

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what
                  you've been through... I should've seen
                  something like this coning.

     Art APPEARS in the door behind Sam.  Kelly cones closer.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Why don't you start fucking her again.
                  You can spend it together.

     Kirk tries to take Kelly's arm.  She jerks away, swings at Sam.

     He ducks, dropping the Waterford BOWL, which SHATTERS upon the
     floor.

     Kirk bear-hugs Kelly.  She throws a notebook at Sam.

<b>                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                  I hate you!

     She starts crying.  Kirk and Nicole drag her away as a crowd
     gathers.

     Sam, shaken, kneels over the broken crystal.  Art bends to help
     him pick up the pieces.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  You see.  I couldn't stay, even if I
                  wanted to.

<b>     EXT. STRIP MALL - NIGHT
</b>
     Sam's Jeep is parked next to the T-bird and Jaguar.

<b>     INT. KEN'S OFFICE - SAME
</b>
     Baxter, Ken, Sandra, Frankie stand watching, as Sam signs papers.
     At last Sam looks up, faces Sandra -- not a happy moment.

     Sandra gives him a long, hard stare, then walks from the room.
     Frankie prepares to follow her, then stops, looks at Sam.

<b>                                  FRANKIE
</b>                  I'll be seeing you.

     Sam just looks at him.  The big man leaves.  Baxter closes his
     briefcase.

<b>                                  KEN
</b>                  So long, Tom.  Come by sometime.  We'll
                  have lunch at the Beef Bowl.

     Baxter stops, gives him a cold look, then a surprising smile.

<b>                                  BAXTER
</b>                  I don't think you're gonna be eating at
                  the Beef Bowl anymore, kid.

     He EXITS.  Ken goes apeshit -- whoops, dances around the desk,
     drops into his chair, holds up the documents.

     Sam watches, smiling, finally.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Thanks Ken, you did okay.

     Both men stand, they shake hands.  Ken claps him on the arm.

<b>                                  KEN

                  it did.  Now take the money and get out

<b>     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT
</b>
     Moonlit fog -- the vast swamp.

<b>     EXT. GLADES MOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
     It's late.  A neon palm tree flashes across an empty lot as...

     Sam's Jeep pulls in out of the night, parks before its bungalow.
     Sam gets out, lifts his storage box of files from the rear.

<b>     INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT
</b>
     The neon's green light slashes across the dark walls through old
     Venetian blinds.

     Sam ENTERS, puts the file box on the floor.  Arches a sore back.

     He reaches for a bedside lamp, stops, listens, decides it's
     nothing, reaches again for the lamp, stops again, listening...

     BZZZZZ -- the high-pitched WHINE of a MOSQUITO.  Then more -- a
     flurry of BZZZZZZZZS

     Sam frowns, sees...

     A cloud of mosquitoes circling him.

     He checks the front windows -- closed.  He goes around the bed.
     The slightly ajar bathroom door with full-length mirror comes up
     on his right.  Ahead is a rear window -- wide open.

     Sam stops fast.
<b>         
</b>     Thinks.  Lets out a breath.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Damn maid.

     He steps to the window.  He looks down --

     Muddy footprints.

     Sam freezes.  He whirls around --

     A sudden green FACE APPEARS in the big mirror -- like a nightmare
     image -- lit by the neon flash, then DISAPPEARS.

     Sam jumps back.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Ahhhh!

     The neon green face flashes again in the mirror -- DISAPPEARS.
     Now the bathroom door slowly opens all the way.

     Sam backs up, hits the wall.

     Kelly Van Ryan steps out of the bathroom, a long object held at
     her side, wrapped in a towel.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  So you got my mom's money.

     Sam tries to breathe, manages a nod.

<b>                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                  How much?

     Kelly prods him with the concealed object.

<b>                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                  How much?

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  About six and a half million dollars.

     Kelly raises the abject covered by the towel, aims it at Sam.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Your turn to pay.

     A moment -- then she yanks the towel away to REVEAL --

     --  a two-foot-long novelty penis with giant balls.  Her hand
     grips the acrylic scrotum like the butt of a gun.

<b>                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                  King Dong!  That's you, Sam!

     She screams with joy, vaults into his arms, wraps those perfect
     thighs around him.  The dildo goes flying.  They fall on the bed.

<b>                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                  It worked!  We screwed the bitch!

     She's all over him now -- tongue kisses.

<b>                                  KELLY CCONT'D)
</b>                  It worked just like you said it would.

     He kisses her, finally gets her to sit, straddling him.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  God, you scared the shit out of me.  You
                  must be crazy coming here.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.

     She kisses him again, more passionately now.  He gets into it,
     tears her blouse open, putting his tongue to her breasts.

     A SHADOW moves on the wall, looming above them.  Sam sees it, his
     eyes widen.  He tries to sit up, as...

     BANG! -- an EXPLOSION.  Sam jumps, knocks Kelly to his side.

     A champagne cork hits the ceiling.

     Suzie Toller stands over the bed with a foaming champagne bottle.

<b>                                  SUZIE
</b>                  How much is about six and a half million
                  divided by three?

<b>                                  SAM

                  thirty-three thousand three hundred
                  thirty-three and change.

     Kelly screams in joy again.

<b>                                  SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                  Now calm down.  Both of you.

     The girls put on mock serious expressions.

<b>                                  SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                  From now on, if we're seen together,
                  it's got to be accidental.  I thought

</b>                  Hey, come on... We've got to have at
                  least one victory party.

     Kelly grabs the champagne, takes a long gulp, pours some on her
     breasts as she straddles Sam once more, inviting him to lick them
     clean.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Kelly, for christ's sake...

     She has begun to move like a lap dancer, inviting him to take her
     breasts in his mouth, putting a hand to his crotch...

<b>                                  SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                  The only way we're gonna blow this now,
                  is if we do it ourselves...

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                         (her hand in his crotch)
                  Do it to ourselves?

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                         (weakening)
                  We have to stick with the plan.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Stick?

     Sam gives up, lays back as Kelly undoes his pants, then moves to
     get him inside her.

     Suzie watches.  She takes another drink, then tosses the bottle,
     pulling off her top, REVEALING her small, white breasts, a couple
     of tattoos, a pierced nipple.  She slips behind Kelly, fondling
     Kelly's breasts as Sam arches beneath them both -- all of them
     totally into it now, losing themselves in the sex...

     The room is dark and empty, with the exception of a single desk
     lamp, by which halo we find...

     Ray Duquette, in an aloha shirt, waiting as his computer's
     printer finishes a job, as suddenly...

     ... a new light rushes into the room.  Ray turns to find Gloria
     standing in the doorway.  He stops as his printer finishes the
     job.  He pulls out the paper, looks at it, smiles.  Gloria walks
     to his desk.

<b>                                  RAY

                  What you were wrong about, is who made

                         (Gloria nods)
                  So why not tell us about the affair?  I

                  The job looks okay to us.  But look at

                         (beat)
                  He was fucked out of it by old man Van
                  Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt
                  Creek Land Deal.
                         (beat)
                  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a
                  corporation to develop swamp land, got
                  investors like Lombardo to put up money,
                  then turned around and got the state to
                  declare the area an ecological preserve,
                  on the sly, of course, but everyone knew
                  it was him.  The freeway went to the
                  coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.

<b>     EXT. A BANK, BLUE BAY - DAY
</b>
     Sam walks down the steps, gets into his Jeep, and drives away.

     Across the street -- the white Taurus -- Ray and Gloria watch.

<b>     EXT. YACHT BROKERAGE - DAY
</b>
     Sam comes out, rounds a corner and is gone.

     Ray Duquette steps INTO FRAME, turns into the brokerage.  The
     door swings shut behind him.

<b>     INT. SWIMMING POOL, BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
     Girls in tank suits finish laps, towel off.  As the girls begin
     to walk toward the lockers, they encounter...

     Ray Duquette, threading his way among the girls, his eye on...

     Kelly, alone on the deck, still dripping -- a Botticelli vision.

<b>                                  RAY (O.S.)
</b>                  Nice stroke.

     Kelly, startled, turns to find Ray walking toward her across the
     deck.  She snatches a towel from one of the racing platforms and
     begins to dry herself, wrapping the towel around her.

<b>                                 KELLY
</b>                  Is there some reason why you're here?

<b>                                 RAY
</b>                  Curiosity, I guess.

<b>                                 KELLY
</b>                  About what?  How to improve your breast

     Ray gives her a cold smile.

<b>                                 RAY
</b>                  Actually, I was curious about how you
                  see things working out, for you, Sam and
                  Suzie.

     This appears to give her pause, a moment of hesitation.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Excuse me?

</b>                  You all gonna go down to the Caribbean
                  together?

     Kelly looks around the pool area.  A number of girls are watching
     from a corner of the deck, but no one is close enough to hear.

<b>                                  RAY (CONT'D)
</b>                  The thing about it is, threesomes so

                  It's hard enough for one person to keep
                  a secret, let alone three.  And then
                  there's the love angle.  I mean do you
                  and Sam really want that little
                  pill-head around, now that you have the
                  money?

     Kelly starts to walk away.  Ray cuts her off.

</b>                  Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea
                  right up front, of whacking Suzie?

<b>                                  KELLY

<b>                                  RAY

                  little ditz Suzie's gonna hold together,
                  do you?

     Kelly continues to walk, her face giving nothing away, as Ray's
     WORDS ECHO over the pool.

<b>     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LONG SHOT - LATER

     Only a few cars left -- one of them Suzie's old VW bug, at the
     side of which Kelly and Suzie engage in heated conversation.

     Kelly tries to take her by the arm.  Suzie jerks away.

                  That's what it was... a fucking hell

     Kelly looks around the lot.  She takes Suzie by the arm once
     more, this time more firmly, pulling Suzie to her.

<b>                                  KELLY

                  Man, I wanna smoke a joint.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL -- in the distance -- the white Ford Taurus
     at the side of the road leading to the school.

     The car is pulled just far enough off the road to be mostly
     hidden among pampas grass and oleander, but angled in such a way
     as to afford a view of the two girls now hugging in the lot.

<b>     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
     Suzie wanders along the canal, smoking a joint.  At her back a
     few faint lights flicker here and there in the windows of
     trailers.  She walks down to the little dock, sits on a rail,
     takes another hit.

<b>                                  VOICE (0.S.)
</b>                  'Evening, Suzie.  How was school today?

     Suzie freezes, holds back her exhale, looking around...

     A shadow stirs in one of the skiffs tied to the dock.  A man
     stands, walks up the couple of wooden stairs.  The light from a
     trailer across the road glances off steel-rimmed glasses as Ray
     Duquette steps onto the dock.

     Suzie gags on the smoke in her lungs, coughs.  She squeezes the
     lit roach into her palm, then tosses it into the canal.

<b>                                  RAY

     He takes a sheet of paper from his coat.

                         (as Suzie takes it)
                  Sam deposited his check, transferred the
                  funds to an offshore bank, a numbered
                  account.  Not even the cops can find out
                  whose names are on it.  Think one of

     Suzie looks over the paper.

<b>                                  RAY (CONT'D)
</b>                  He also put a down on some island

     Suzie thrusts the paper back at Ray.

     Suzie tries to back away.  She bumps against the rail.  Ray
     reaches out, takes her hand in both of his.

     Suzie looks scared, in a way she hasn't before.  When she speaks
     her voice is scarcely above a whisper.

                  That's right.  That was his name.

     The smile fades, as if he's thinking about something, still
     holding her hand, rubbing it with his fingers.

<b>                                  RAY (CONT'D)

                  dumb as you pretend to be.

     He looks into Suzie's eyes, slowly opening her hand to REVEAL the
     burn mark on her palm.

<b>                                  RAY (CONT'D)

                  I'd hate to see you come to a bad end.
                  Like Davy did.

     He holds her hand a moment longer, then drops it.  He goes back
     down he steps to the little skiff.  An outboard MOTOR STARTS in
     the night.

<b>     INT. SUZIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     highway crosses both the canal and the road to the fish camp.

     The skiff has been shoved into the bed.  Ray sits at the wheel.
     He removes his glasses, wipes his face with a handkerchief, then
     starts at the uneven 50UNDS of a tired ENGINE, looks up to see...

<b>     HEADLIGHTS

     Suzie's VW bouncing along the dirt road, turning onto the
     highway.

<b>     RAY'S TRUCK - RAY

     watching, then starting his truck and pulling out onto the
     highway, following the tiny red lights of Suzie's bug.

<b>     SXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - MAIN GATE - NIGHT
</b>
     Suzie's VW idles.  She leans out the window, talks to the
     intercom, the gate opens.  The VW ENTERS.  The gate closes.

     Ray's pickup drives past.  He drives to a big lot where one of
     the mansions has been torn down.  He drives up onto the dirt,
     keeps going, right down to the water's edge where he pulls his
     little skiff out of the back once more.

     He walks back to the truck, pulls off his sport coat, hangs a
     Hi-8 video camera over his shoulder and wades out into the calm
     waters of the bay, pushing the skiff, then climbing in.

<b>     EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, REAR OF MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Suzie follows Kelly past the pool, which is all lit~up, and on
     toward the jacuzzi.  The whole deck is tiled in black-and-white.

     Kelly's in a bikini -- the killer body.  Suzie, the contrast --
     pale, skinny, boyish, in a T-shirt and cutoff jeans.  They
     argue -- we CANNOT HEAR.

<b>     EXT. THE BAY - SAME
</b>
     Ray has arrived near the docks.  He has killed his engine,
     maneuvering here with a single oar.  He ties the skiff off behind
     the Jonathan, then climbs to the dock, moving around the guest
     house and coming close to the pool.  He takes a position behind
     the cabanas, readies his camera.

     The bedside lamp is on.  Sam is on the phone.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Kelly.  Is Suzie there?

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left
                  this garbled message on my machine.
                         (beat)
                  Can you calm her down?

<b>                                  KELLY (V.0.)

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm
                  counting on you.  You calm her down.
                  I mean do whatever you have to, whatever
                  it takes...

<b>                                  KELLY (V.O.)

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly.
                  Do it tonight.  We'll figure something
                  out... Okay?

<b>     EXT. JACUZZI - NIGHT

     Kelly glances across the steamy water at Suzie.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Yeah, right.  Can you at least talk to
                  her, on the phone?

<b>     NT. SAM'S BUNGALOW - SAME
</b>
     Sam lies on his bed, waits for Suzie's voice on the line.

<b>                                  SUZIE (V.O.)
</b>                  Sam...

     The girls stand cheek-to-cheek, the phone between them.

<b>                                  KELLY

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Okay.  I want you to hear this too.
                  We've got to be cool.  All of us.
                  People think I'm rich, for Christ's
                  sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.
                         (beat)
                  I'm spending my money.  It's more
                  suspicious if I sit around doing
                  nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck
                  with your minds.

<b>     EXT. CABANAS - NIGHT

     Ray tapes the scene.

     The girls still hold the phone.

<b>                                  SUZIE
</b>                  But I..

<b>                                  SAM (V.0.)
</b>                  Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only
                  people who can blow this is us.
                  Remember?

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Right.

     Suzie says nothing.  Kelly nudges her.

<b>                                  SUZIE
</b>                  Yeah, right.

<b>                                  SAM (V.0.)
</b>                  Good.  Just keep telling yourselves
                  that, the only people who can fuck this
                  up is us.

     The line goes dead.  Kelly hangs up.  Suzie stares into the
     jacuzzi.

<b>                                  SUZIE
</b>                  You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Oh, for Christ's sake.

<b>                                  SUZIE
</b>                  You are.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Are you retarded, or just brain dead
                  from whiffin' fumes out there in the
                  swamp...

     Suzie's face goes hard.

<b>                                  SUZIE
</b>                  That's what I am to you, isn't it?
                  Swamp trash.  It's what I am to
                  everybody, just like my mom...

     Kelly tries to put an arm around her.  Suzie slaps her -- a
     mistake -- Kelly's bigger, faster.  She slaps the side of Suzie's
     head, then grabs her legs, dumping her on the tile deck.

<b>     ON RAY

     focusing the camera.

     Suzie tries to kick Kelly.

     Something changes in Kelly, a scary, calm rage.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Stupid bitch.

     She very methodically grabs Suzie's hair, dragging her into the
     jacuzzi, holding her under the hot water.

     Suzie thrashes, breaks free, gags, arches out of the water, the
     wet T-shirt clinging to her small breasts.

     Kelly is on her again, slaps her, puts her hands to Suzie's
     throat -- violently sexual in her wet bikini.

     Kelly slams Suzie back onto the black-and-white tile, gets on top
     of her, knees between Suzie's legs, her hands on her throat.

     Suzie's skinny shape writhes underneath Kelly on the gleaming
     tile.  She gasps for air.  Kelly finally lets go, but remains on
     her knees between Suzie's legs, breathing hard.  A moment.  Kelly
     touches Suzie's face.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Why do you make me hurt you?  It's like
                  you want it or something.

     Suzie sobs, takes Kelly's hand.

<b>                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                  God, you are scared, aren't you?

     Suzie runs her lips over Kelly's fingers, then pushes her T-shirt
     up, pushing Kelly's hand onto her breast.

<b>                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                  And this is going to make you feel
                  better, make you trust me...

     Suzie nods, tearing her T-shirt, getting both of Kelly's hands
     onto her breasts, then pushing at Kelly's wrists, getting her to
     pull at her nipples, hard... Kelly obliges...

     Suzie cries out in pain.  Kelly's hands move down to pull off
     Suzie's bottoms...

<b>     ON RAY
</b>
     still at it with the video, his face impassive, watching.

     As Kelly pulls Suzie back into the jacuzzi, as the girls' hands
     slide round the curves of each other's hips, pulling themselves
     to each other, as the layers of steam rise to envelope them...

     a loud SLAP.

     Sam, angry, sits in the corridor with a uniformed officer.

     Hunter sees Sam, rolls his eyes.

                  manipulative psychopath.  And those

     Sam lunges at Ray.  The officer and Hunter restrain him.  Gloria
     looks on, taken aback by Ray's accusations, Sam's response.

<b>                                  HUNTER

     can be separated once again.

     Sam EXXTS a building, a large package of wrapped goods beneath
     his arm.  He looks toward the parking lot where --

     Barbara Baxter stands beside the red Mercedes.  She tips a valet
     then starts toward the mall.  She sees San.  Their eyes meet.  A
     moment of hesitation, as neither is quite sure what to say.

<b>                                  SAM

</b>                  Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend

     as...

     ... in b.g., a BLACK RANGE ROVER -- just the roof VISIBLE above
     the tops of the other cars, cruises the lot.

<b>     INT. RANGE ROVER - KELLY VAN RYAN

     Sam and Barbara stand in the orange light, hand-in-hand.  Barbara
     leans forward, kisses Sam on the lips.

     lost in thought, when she is startled by a sudden CACOPHONY of
     ENGINE NOISE.  She turns to find...

     Suzie's BUG, SPLUTTERING and BELCHING smoke, parks next to her.

     Suzie opens the door of the Rover, jumps in.  She's wearing a
     black ball cap, armed with a huge straw bag.  As she settles in
     the seat, she lets out a long breath.

     Kelly makes a face, fans the air.

     Kelly turns off the engine.  Suzie tokes on a joint, swills the

     staggers.  Kelly circles her with an arm, looks nervously around,
     begins leading her down the beach.

</b>                  I wanna live at the beach someday.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Shit.

     She stops walking.  Suzie takes a few more steps then turns to
     look at her.

<b>                                  KELLY (CONT'D)
</b>                  I left the keys.  I'll get 'em.

     Suzie plops down on the sand, drinks from the bottle.  She
     watches Kelly fading into the darkness, mumbles something beneath
     her breath, then lies on her back.

<b>     SUZIE'S POV - THE NIGHT SKY
</b>
     The SOUND of CRASHING WAVES.  She rolls to one side, looking down
     the beach

     Murky blackness.

     She tries to focus, sits up.

<b>                                  SUZIE
</b>                  Kelly?

     She stands -- wobbly -- peers down the beach.

     A shape EMERGES in the blackness, moving toward her.

<b>                                  SUZIE (CONT'D)
</b>                  Kelly?

     The shape gets closer and closer, until...

     Sam Lombardo steps up to loom over Suzie.

     She takes a step back.

     Sam puts a hand on her shoulder.  He carries something in his
     other hand -- hard to see on the dark beach.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Suzie, it's okay.  It's me.

     Suzie steadies herself.  A face APPEARS behind Sam -- Kelly.

<b>                                  SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                  I was worried about you, Suzie.  I
                  decided we should all get together, one
                  more time, before we split up.

<b>                                  SUZIE
</b>                  Are you mad at me?

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  No, no.  Look, I probably should have
                  told you a little more, about the part I
                  intended to play.
                         (beat)
                  We'll go through it all again tonight.

     Sam takes the bottle from Suzie, looks at it.

<b>                                  SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                  This is a celebration Suzie, not a
                  suicide pact.

     He lifts the object in his other hand -- a champagne battle.

<b>                                  SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                  We'll chill out first, have a drink,
                  watch the stars.

     Suzie nods.

<b>                                  SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                  Kelly, there's a beach blanket in the
                  Jeep.  Could you get it for us?

     Kelly nods, starts back, looks once over her shoulder as...

     Sam leads Suzie toward a huge rock formation.

<b>                                  SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                  Let me tell you about this boat I picked
                  out for us...

     They move OUT OF SIGHT.  Kelly continues to walk, back along the
     sand toward the cars.

<b>     INSERT - A SCREAM
</b>
     A sickening hollow THWACK -- an arc of blood and two teeth fall
     silently on dark stone.

     Kelly begins to run, stumbling through the sand to Sam's Jeep,
     where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind the
     seats.  She stuffs it under her arm, then runs back along the
     beach.  As she runs, she can hear them -- more THWACKS, MOANS --
     it seems like forever

     Sam APP£ARS before her on the sand.  The champagne bottle swings
     loosely at the end of one arm.  it looks shiny now, dripping with
     Suzie's blood.

     Kelly goes to him.  She looks at the bottle, then throws herself
     against him -- a hard kiss.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to
                  happen like this.  She was losing it...

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                         (breathless)
                  There was no way.  That cop would've
                  gotten her to tell him... everything.
                  She was weak and dumb...

     She kisses him again, her hands moving over his body.  Sam takes
     a step back, looks into Kelly's face -- the parted lips, sultry
     eyes -- as if seeing her for the first time -- a long beat -- at
     which point he turns, heaving the champagne bottle as far as he
     can into the black waves.

<b>     EXT. RANGE ROVER ON THE SAUD - LATER
</b>
     Rear hatch open -- overhead light on.

     Sam and Kelly drag Suzie's body -- wrapped in the plastic -- to
     the rear hatch.  As they heft her inside, the light catches --

<b>     SUZIE'S FACE
</b>
     A mask of blood.

     Kelly turns away in disgust.  She goes to the passenger side
     door, gets in.

     Sam gets in behind the wheel.  For a moment the two of them just
     sit there, in the darkness, with the SOUND of the SEA, and their
     own BREATHING.  Sam looks at Kelly.

     She is focused on the dark Atlantic.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Are you okay?

     Kelly turns to him -- an anxious face.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                         (a long beat)
                  My mom would kill me if she knew I took
                  the Rover.

<b>     EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT
</b>
     Kelly waits by the Rover, swatting mosquitoes.

     SLOSHING SOUNDS -- a shape approaches in the dark -- Sam in
     waders, muddy, tired, carrying a shovel.

<b>     EXT. GALLERIA PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
     Almost empty of cars.  The Range Rover cruises past Suzie's VW,
     circles, comes back.  Sam jumps out, pulls on latex gloves, gets
     into the VW and backs it out.

<b>     EXT. BUS TERMINAL (MIAMI) - DAY
</b>
     Almost dawn.  A long parking lot fronts the terminal.  Suzie's VW
     arrives, parks, Sam gets out.  He goes to the waiting Range
     Rover, gets in and drives away.

<b>     EXT. FRONT GATE - VAN RYAN ESTATE - DAY
</b>
<b>     A THIN STREAM OF MUDDY WATER
</b>
     flows beneath the gate, down the drive, toward the street.

     A HAND touches the water.

     PULL BACK to REVEAL the hand as that of Ray Duquette.

<b>     EXT. VAN RYAN DRIVEWAY - SAME
</b>
     Ray kneels, fingers wriggling in the water, then straightens,
     looking toward the house where...

     On the other side of the gate, Kelly, in a tube-top and tight
     shorts, washes mud from the Range Rover.  She looks up, sees...

     Ray, drying his hand on a handkerchief, walking up the drive,
     arriving at the wrought-iron gates.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  Been four-wheelin'?

     Kelly freezes -- not so cool this time.

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  Get off my property.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  I'm not on your property!

     He grabs the wrought-iron gate -- rattles it -- harder and
     harder.

     Kelly backs away, frightened.

<b>     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - DAY
</b>
     Gloria and Ray stand in front of the ramshackle wooden building,
     talking to Ruby.  Walter sits nearby, sharpening a knife.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  You say she didn't come back last night.

<b>                                  RUBY
</b>                  She's been sayin' she was going to go to
                  L.A.  But I don't know.  I mean all her
                  clothes are still here.  An' she's
                  missin' her graduation.
                         (a long beat)
                  She should graduate.  She's a smart
                  girl...

     Ray nods.  He makes a note in his pad.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  May have been she just partied too
                  much... But we'll look into it.  We find
                  something, you'll be the first to know.

     Ray turns and walks to the car.  Gloria follows.

<b>     INT. CAR - SAME
</b>
     Ray sits for a moment behind the wheel.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it
                  begins...

</b>                  Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She
                  could be anywhere...

     Ray silences her with a look.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  I'm gonna take you back to the office.

<b>                                  GLORIA
</b>                  You have someplace to be?

     Ray starts the car, doesn't answer.

     Gloria nods.  She looks toward the camp store where the old lady
     can still be SEEN standing on the porch, beneath the jawbones.

<b>     EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

     Caps and gowns -- kids and parents on the lawn -- taking photos.

     Kelly poses with Sandra.  Tom Baxter aims the camera.

</b>                  That's one for the scrapbook.

     Baxter moves away, greets Nicole and her parents.

     Kelly puts some room between her and Sandra.

<b>                                  KELLY

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  A friend of mine bought a boat.

     Sandra shakes her head, walks off.

     Kelly turns away, freezes, as she catches sight of --

     Ray talking with Jimmy.

<b>     EXT. THE BEACH - DAY
</b>
     Ray and Jimmy walk along the sand, moving in the direction of the
     big rocks.  Jimmy wears sagger shorts, a surfer T-shirt.  Ray
     wears a suit.  He carries the coat over his shoulder.

<b>                                  JIMMY
</b>                  It's those rocks, up there.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  You and Suzie used to come out here
                  together?

<b>                                  JIMMY
</b>                  Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang
                  out here.
                         (beat)
                  You really think something bad happened
                  to Suzie?

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                         (ignoring the question)
                  Lombardo ever come out here?

     Jimmy looks at him, surprised, sees that Ray is serious.  Still,
     the idea generates a laugh.

<b>                                  RAY (CONT'D)
</b>                  I say something funny?

<b>                                  JIMMY
</b>                  No.  But I mean... just the idea that
                  Mr. Lombardo would...

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with
                  the kids, one of the guys...

<b>                                  JIMMY
</b>                  Yeah, but...

     He breaks off as Ray kneels over a big flat rock.  Ray brushes
     away some sand, drapes the sport coat over his arm, taking
     tweezers and latex gloves from the pockets.

     Jimmy moves closer, curious, seeing what Ray sees.

<b>     CLOSE ON GLOVED HANDS
</b>
     as tweezers pick up two teeth from a crevice in the stone.

     Ray straightens, holding the teeth in the palm of his hand.

     Jimmy stares at the teeth.

     Ray takes a couple of bills from his pocket, hands them to Jimmy.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  I'm going to be staying here, Jimmy.
                  You can catch a bus up there at the lot,
                  okay?

     Jimmy looks a little sick, but he takes the money.  He starts
     toward the lot.

     Ray watches for a moment.  Then calls out to him.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  People aren't always what they appear to
                  be, kid.  Remember it.

     Jimmy looks at him, trying to make sense of what Ray is saying,
     clearly disturbed by the implications.  But he asks no more
     questions.  He turns, trudging alone back through the sand.

     Ray, Gloria and Hunter watch as DAVE MERRITT, a forensic expert
     bags the teeth.  He passes the bag to Ray, then bends to the
     rocks where he begins to take a blood sample.

</b>                  She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought,
                  I would just go with her, stand at the
                  door...
                         (shaking his head)
                  I think I looked away.  A split second.
                  Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts
                  a knee into my groin.
                         (beat)
                  There was this coffee table between us
                  and the wall.  She got one foot on that
                  thing and launched herself at the gun
                  case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could
                  hear it breaking.
                         (beat)
                  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up,
                  just enough.  Before I could get to her,
                  she'd turned on me with this small
                  caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put
                  it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it
                  in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice.
                  I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think.
                  In the chest.

     number of plainclothes police, Hunter and Gloria among them,

     Brilliant sun on turquoise water.  A few boats anchored in a

     Heading out -- a forty-foot sloop, Sam at the helm.

<b>     INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Gloria, Baxter, a tearful Sandra, sit in seats, watch as --

     Ray stands before a panel, A SUIT, A CHIEF in uniform, Hunter.

     Ray wears a suit, his hair neatly trimmed.  His arm is no longer
     in a sling, but one of his hands is still bandaged.

<b>                                  CHIEF

                  concludes that this was a good shooting.
                  But that's irrelevant.  You were not
                  assigned to this case -- whatever you
                  imagined this case to be.  And now two

                  terminated with forfeiture of pension
                  and benefits.

     Ray looks at the floor.

     Hunter coughs.  His hands rest on a file -- we SEE the video
     cassette inside -- labeled "TOLLER/VAN RYAN -- CONFIDENTIAL."

                  found near the area known as Stoner
                  Rocks.  Suzie's blood was found in the
                  Van Ryan Range Rover.  This, in
                  conjunction with evidence obtained by
                  Detectives Duquette and Perez has led
                  this office to the conclusion that Susan
                  Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly
                  Lanier Van Ryan...

     Sandra chokes back a sob.  She gets to her feet, to be led from
     the room by Tom Baxter.

     Gloria Perez watches, a sad look in her eye, then turns to look
     at Ray.  His back is to her -- the broad shoulders, expensive
     suit.  His hands are clasped behind his back.

     Gloria stands among a considerable number of mourners.  She is
     just back from Sandra and Tom Baxter, who, in turn, are just back
     from the open grave.

     As Gloria watches, Sandra looks off to the side, where something
     catches her eye.  Gloria sees her start, then follows her gaze.

<b>     ANGLE ON CEMETERY - GLORIA'S POV
</b>
     On a rise some fifty yards from the Van Ryan plot, two people
     stand near an old oak -- Ruby and Walter.

     When Gloria looks back at Sandra, it seems to her as if the woman
     has slumped against Tom Baxter, who now stares at the two people
     on the rise as if, by doing so with sufficient intensity, he
     might make them disappear.

     Gloria turns to the grave site, her eye lingers on the open
     grave, then moves to the huge marker which dominates the Van Ryan
     family plot and, in fact, the entire scene.

<b>     ANGLE CN MARKER

     The angel Gabriel, trumpet in hand, carved in relief upon a huge
     obelisk of black marble.  Beneath the angel is a carved scroll
     and upon it the words:

     Sam Lombardo walks along a moonlit lagoon, headed toward a lone
     bungalow.

     The bungalow is simple, picturesque -- whitewashed walls, a
     thatched roof.  A patio opens onto the beach.

<b>     EXT. PATIO - SAME

     As Sam steps in off the sand, he sees something and stops short.

     Wet spots lead toward the bungalow.

     Sam listens.  Everything is quiet.

<b>     INT. BUNGALOW - SAME
</b>
     Sam ENTERS in a room lit only by the blue light of a large
     aquarium.  He listens once more, hears it -- RUNNING WATER.

     He moves down a short hallway, observes the light which spills
     from beneath a bedroom door.  He pushes it open, goes inside.

<b>     INT. BEDROOM - SAME
</b>
     He CROSSES the room.

     The bathroom door is ajar, the room leaking steam.

<b>     INT. BATHROOM - SAME
</b>
     Sam steps inside, looks at the shower stall -- an indistinct
     shape moves there in the steam.

     San watches, then jerks open the shower door.  The steam
     clears -- REVEALING a tall, athletic body, and now the face --

     Ray Duquette, grinning at Sam out of the swirling steam.

                  tomorrow.

     Ray turns off the water, steps out of the stall, wrapping himself
     in a towel.  There's a fresh, raised scar across one shoulder and
     Ray winces a little as he tucks the towel about his waist.  He
     looks at himself in the mirror, touching the scar.

<b>                                  RAY

     Sam just looks at him.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  Yeah, well, you fixed that.

     Sam shakes his head, walks back into the bedroom.  Ray follows.

                  supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.

     Ray walks to a dresser where a bottle of champagne sits in a
     bucket of ice.  He opens the bottle, fills two glasses.  He hands
     one of the glasses to Sam.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  Every cloud has a silver lining,

     He raises his glass in a toast.

     Sam looks at it, then raises his glass as well.  Ray smiles.  Sam
     doesn't.

<b>                                  SAM

     drink.

<b>     EXT. SMALL BOAT HARBOR (ISLAND) - DAY

     Sam and Ray work on the deck of Sam's sloop, stowing gear,

     Palms sway.  The men work in silence.

     Gloria drives up in the white Taurus.  She parks before the
     ramshackle old building and the gator pen.

     Walter is in the pen.  Ruby stands just outside of it.  She looks
     toward the road as Gloria gets out, then back to the pen.

     Gloria comes down the bank to stand beside Ruby.  She's just in
     time to see the huge old reptile raise itself, hissing, on its
     front legs, jaws sprung wide.  The women watch as Walter sticks
     his arm into the gator's mouth.

                  He don't use it for no good deeds
                  anyway.

     Walter looks at the ladies, picks up the stick and sweeps it
     between the gaping jaws, which snap in its wake.

<b>     EXT. OCEAN - DAY

     From the surface of the sea -- the emerald island in the
     distance.  The bow of the sloop comes INTO FRAME.

     On board -- Sam stands in the cockpit, at the helm.  Ray lounges
     on the deck.  The boat sails easily before the wind.

                  Take a couple of turns on it for me,

     Ray cranes his neck to look at the winch.

<b>                                  RAY

                  And these are shrouds, and these are

<b>                                  RAY

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  Yeah, or get me drowned.

     Ray kneels.  He begins to tighten the winch.

     Sam watches him for a moment, then reaches around behind his back
     to unhook the short line which holds the boom.

     The mainsail catches wind, swinging the boom in a wide arc,
     directly at Ray.

     Ray looks up, sees it coming just in time to catch it on his arm.

     The blow is enough to send him sprawling through the lifelines,
     where he just manages to grab one of the nylon cords.

     Sam ducks as the boon continues to swing erratically above the
     deck, watching as Ray hauls himself on board.

     The boat no longer driven by the wind, bobs up and down on a
     small ground swell.

     The two men face each other.

<b>                                  SAM

</b>                  Come off it, man... It was an accident.

     Ray nods, then reaches down, pulls off the winch handle and
     starts with it toward Sam.

     Sam looks around.  He jerks open a storage compartment.  A
     diver's weight belt tumbles out.  Sam grabs it, swings it over
     his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum,
     preparing to throw.

     Ray crouches, still brandishing the winch handle.  The boom
     sweeps the deck.

     Sam throws the belt.

     Ray grabs a shroud, dances out of the way, then steadies himself,
     a mean grin spreading across his face.

     There's no tine for Sam to look for anything else.

     Ray moves quickly across the deck -- a menacing sight -- tall,
     well-muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand.

     Sam pulls himself out of the cockpit.  Ray jumps in.  But that's
     as far as he gets.

     WHOOSH -- A spear pierces Ray's thigh.  He screams, goes down,
     the handle skittering across the deck.

     Ray follows it with his eyes, reaching out, then freezing as he
     sees something else.  He draws in his hand as if bitten.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  You... You're...

     He scuttles backward, pulling himself onto the deck, clutching at
     his leg which squirts blood as if an artery has been severed.
     But his eyes never leave the hatchway leading belowdecks.

<b>                                  RAY (CONT'D)
</b>                  You're dead... for godsake...

     The boat heels over.  The spear in Ray's thigh bangs against the
     edge of the cockpit.  He grimaces in pain as...

     Suzie Toller steps up from belowdecks.  She's wearing a bikini
     and showing a nice tan.  She's carrying Sam's new spear gun, a
     fresh spear at the ready.

<b>                                  SUZIE
</b>                  Rumors of my demise have been greatly

                  Nice move.  Good thing I was here to
                  save your incompetent ass.

     Sam secures the boom.  Ray stares at Suzie, his face twisted with
     some combination of pain, rage and fear.

<b>                                  RAY

                         (to Sam)
                  Get him in the water.

     San starts for Ray.

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  Sam, for Christ's sake...

     Sam's feet slide in the bloody smear.  He stops.

     Ray clings to a safety line.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                  I can't.

     WHOOSH -- A second spear penetrates Ray's shoulder.  He loses his
     grip.  The boat heels over, dumping Ray into the water.

     Suzie puts down her spear gun.  She goes to a storage locker,
     takes out a bait bucket.  She steps up on the deck.

     Ray is floating not far from the boat, the water going red around
     him.  He calls out...

<b>                                  RAY
</b>                  Sam, for godsake.

                  numbered bank account besides yours and
                  Sam's?

     She raises the bucket, heaves bloody chum into the water.

                  don't have to worry.  Are you worrying,
                  Ray?

     She heaves more chum -- a big red slurp across Ray's face.

     Ray gasps, goes under, thrashing around in the red slick.

     already filled.

                  you think?  No loose ends.

     Sam just looks at her.

     Suzie smiles -- showing the big gap where her two front teeth
     used to be.

                  Come on Sam, we did it.  We put the
                  screws to the Van Ryans.  We won.

     She hands a glass to Sam, takes the other.  He puts it to his
     lips, suddenly hesitates, thinks, sniffs the glass.

     A moment.  Suzie shakes her head.

                  I'll get the winch.

     Suzie gives him her best, gap-toothed smile, then comes forward
     to take the gleaming chrome wheel, as Sam scrambles up on deck,
     kneeling where Ray had kneeled before him to set the jib.

     Suzie watches -- a long beat, then, slowly reaches behind her,
     unhooking the line which holds the boom...

<b>     EXT. SMILING JACK'S - SUZIE'S ROOM - DAY

     Gloria sits on Suzie's bed, books spread out around her.  Ruby
     stands beside her.

                  she could find on it, the Van Ryans too.

     Ruby takes a photo album from among the books, opens it, tosses a
     photograph on the bed.  It is one we have seen before.

<b>     ANGLE ON PHOTO

     A stately old gentleman in a three-piece suit.  White hair, a
     white handlebar mustache.  A derby on his knee, a walking stick
     at his side.  He stares out at the world from a high-backed
     wicker chair, flanked by potted palms and two small terriers.

     Across the bottom of the picture is the name -- "WILLIAM TECUMSEH
     VAN RYAN."  And beside that, in another hand -- "Dear old Dad."

                  come down here, hunt and whore, act like
                  assholes.  One trip he showed up with
                  this young girl he'd picked up
                  somewhere, gotten her pregnant then
                  dumped her in the swamp.

     They have gotten to the main room and Gloria stops short,
     noticing for the first time that the beat-up old black-and-white
     TV has been replaced by a high-tech, giant-screen television.

     For a moment there is nothing more than a few ripples across the

     across the oily waters.

                  don't want to see yourself doing them.

     BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then

<b>     INT. JIM'S RECOVERY ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Sam lounges in a booth.  He looks hot, bored.  He stirs a drink.
     Kelly walks in out of the light.  She is looking a little strung
     out, a big straw bag slung over one shoulder, but oh, so sexy in
     skimpy cutoffs and cowboy boots -- long legs flashing as she
     nears Sam's booth.  Sam looks up, as...

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                  I'm running away.

<b>                                  SAM
</b>                         (a beat)
                  You think that's wise?

<b>                                  KELLY
</b>                         (sitting next to him)
                  Um-huh.  And guess what else?
                         (reaching into her bag)
                  I have toys.

     She takes out a snail bag of white powder, taps out a line on the
     table top.

     Sam looks at it.  He looks at Kelly.  He's had a few drinks.

</b>                         (a long beat)
                  Well, Z guess one taste wouldn't hurt.

<b>     END CREDITS.

     The seal comes up.  It's over.  They head for the lobby -- but --

<b>     EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
     Gloria stands beneath the jawbones, looking toward the channel as
     the shadows lengthen across the dirt road.

<b>     ANGLE ON CHANNEL
</b>
     Walter hangs a "FOR SALE" sign on a small, shabby sloop.

     Gloria CROSSES the road.

<b>                                  GLORIA
</b>                  Selling your boat?

     Walter shoots her a look.

<b>                                  WALTER
</b>                  This was Suzie's boat.  Guess she won't
                  be needin' it.

<b>                                  GLORIA
</b>                  I wouldn't have guessed Suzie was a
                  sailor.

     Walter finishes with the sign.

<b>                                  WALTER
</b>                  Old lady had her tested once.  They said
                  her IQ was way up there, round two
                  hundred or some such shit.
                         (beat)
                  That girl could do just about anything,
                  she put her mind to it.

     Gloria has nothing to say.  She stares at the little sloop
     bobbing in the muddy water of the swamp.

<b>     EXT. THE CARIBBEAN - WIDE ANGLE - SEA LEVEL - DAY
</b>
     A head bobs among the groundswells.

<b>     CLOSE - SAM LOMBARDO
</b>
     sucking wind through a smashed face, struggling to stay afloat,
     as...

     ... in the distance, the sloop races toward a far horizon.

<b>     ANGLE ON SLOOP - HELICOPTER SHOT
</b>
     Suzie, at the helm, looking good, face to the wind.


                                <u>END</u>
