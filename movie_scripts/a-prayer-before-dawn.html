was a war."

    strong...raw skin, callused, with hard scar tissue build-up.
    Knuckles raised and damaged...They unfold a scrap of aluminum
    foil with a red pill inside it: `YABA'...Southeast Asia's
    crack cocaine.

    Zippo sparks beneath the foil -- Huge inhale, fumes rise and
    steam a glass Pyrex pipe.

    The Man chokes back, tries to hold the toke. He burps, smoke
    spurting from his nostrils.

    Meet BILLY MOORE...mid-20's, rugged, handsome, intense.

    We HEAR THAI VOICES O.C., sharp tones. Billy moves to a wall
    of rotted wood planks that divides the shack into two
    "rooms." He peers through a crack, SEES --

    BILLY'S POV: a larger MUAY THAI BOXER in his 30's (ECKACHAI).
    Barrel chest, crude. A TRAINER holds mitts as Eckachai snaps
    HARD/LOUD COMBOS of knees/fists. It's intimidating as hell.

    Billy stares through the cracks...Suddenly, a distant CROWD
    ROARS. A thousand voices firing at once, and we --

    by GAMBLERS. It's loud, primal...A Thai promoter, PAPA (50's)
    commentates rapid-fire on a mic, his voice echoing over bad
    speakers as his wife, MAMA, shouts from the crowd...

    In the ring, the smaller child boxer, NINDAM, is on the attack
    -- Bodies twisting, grappling, their tiny fists, knees and
    shins crashing, as--

    gets ready. Shirt off, his ripped build, battle scarred...He
    POUNDS a cement post with his bare fist. One blow after another,
    fists then forearms...Slow, dense thuds, tempering his nerves
    NOT to feel, as--

    stands, legs apart and brutally slams a 4x4 BOARD against each

    kick to the jaw...

    ...and Opponent drops cold. Crowd roars. TRAINERS swarm in.
    The REFEREE lifts Nindam's arm in victory. He smiles.

    As Nindam exits the ring, two ADULT THAI FIGHTERS climb in...
    Papa intros each, new odds soar. That fast, while --

    paces the room, anxiety rising, a caged beast...He pauses...
    drops his shorts and cup guard, then grips his knees and
    takes several fast, deep breaths....

    Billy...sopping sweat...yanks up his guard/shorts...His hands
    are shaking as he wraps them in KNOTTED ROPE...

    We HEAR the SOUND of Eckachai leaving. Billy peeks outside
    the shack, sees Eckachai and his Trainer walking away...

    Billy smokes more Yaba. Breathes it deep in his lungs.

    AND THE DOOR BANGS OPEN. Nindam enters -- Billy spins, quick
    hides his pipe and foil in a gym bag, just in time;

    Nindam says something in Thai, grabs a pair of BOXING GLOVES
    and helps Billy put them on.

    There's a feeling of urgency, that Billy is late.

    As Nindam ties and tapes the gloves, Billy is too high/amped
    and avoids Nindam's gaze.

    After, both nod, bump fists.

    they cross a TRASH STREWN ALLEY lined with other shacks, slum

     Two other MEN quickly carry a BLOODIED, UNCONSCIOUS FIGHTER on
     a stretcher, the opposite way;

     rise...They enter the slum gym...

<b>9    INT. RING: SLUM GYM - AS BILLY STEPS THROUGH THE ROPES           9

     with Nindam and Papa. Adrenaline charged...methamphetamine
     spiked POV, he darts a look to the crowd: Gamblers trading
     fistfuls of cash. Mama rallies loudly in Thai...A wired Billy
     turns to Eckachai in the opposite corner with his Trainer...

     The crowd getting louder...LOUDER...

     Nindam and Papa, and Trainer exit the ring.

     A COW-BELL rings for ROUND ONE.

<b>     BILLY + ECKACHAI
</b>     come out firing -- Explosive trades, bone-on-bone impact --
     Through BILLY'S HEIGHTENED SENSES, we FEEL the visceral rage--

     Mid-round, Billy sees an opening and SMASHES a hook to
     Eckachai's jaw -- He hits the canvas hard -- Crowd ROARS --

     Eckachai gets up -- Billy charges, a wild boar -- two fisted,
     savage attack to the head and body....Eckachai survives.

     sits. Papa and Nindam, as cornermen, go to work...but Billy's
     HEART IS RACING, PULSE POUNDING, TOO FAST -- the drugs have
     zapped his energy. As Billy inhales several sharp breaths, a
     strange RINGING fades in OVER the following...

     -- GAMBLERS' hands signals, the odds rising;

     -- MAMA watching, concerned;

     -- PAPA and NINDAM shouting instructions to Billy, but he/we
     can't hear them, only this shrill RINGING...

     -- ECKACHAI gets off his stool, revived and ready;

<b>     AND THE BELL FOR ROUND TWO.

     HEAVILY, THUNDERING HAYMAKERS THAT MISS and MISS --

     Nindam, screaming encouragement in Thai as --

     Eckachai AVOIDS, then SLAMS an elbow into Billy's eye, jarring
     and concussive -- Billy staggers, blinking, dazed...

     Eckachai unleashes a ROUNDHOUSE KICK and Billy's out on
     impact.

     BILLY'S HEAD bounces off the canvas -- eyes flash -- brain
     stem shocked. SENSES CONTORT...He tries to get up as the Ref
     counts over him. Takes seconds, feels like hours. AS HIS
     SENSES RECONNECT ...Billy climbs to his feet -- but the Ref
     counts "Sip!" (ten)

     The fight's over.

     The crowd goes crazy, IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR, as --

     Billy protests to the Ref, who affirms in Thai. Billy doesn't
     understand.

     CORNERMEN pour in. Ref and Billy keep arguing. Nindam gets
     between them -- Ref violently SHOVES Nindam away, and --

     Billy reacts -- hair trigger fast -- HEADBUTTS Ref full in
     the face. Ref goes down. A nasty cut opens above Billy's eye
     as he KICKS/STOMPS the Ref with MANIC, UNCONTROLLABLE RAGE --

     BOUNCERS/OTHERS swarm over Billy, forcibly restraining him
     from killing the Ref -- He tries fighting them too --

     NOW PAPA FORCES IN -- grabs Billy hard around the neck, yanks
     him close, sees the drugs in his eyes...And Billy knows it.

     Billy's POV, SEES: Nindam is crying. SEES: the Ref writhing on
     the floor, blood oozing through cupped fingers. SEES: the crowd
     roaring. All of it, a disaster.

</b>

     From Billy's DRUGGED POV, IMAGES are kinetic and abstract, a
     nightmarish KALEIDOSCOPE:

     Flashing lights.   Psychoactive.   Multicolored.

     Shadows pass/undulate. Stray dogs everywhere...

     SOUNDS are discordant, reverberating: Car horns. Motorbikes.
     People talking, laughing, shouting...

     Billy moves through it, focus jumping, blurring. Everything
     pulsing, pounding, claustrophobic.

<b>13   INT. GO-GO CLUB: RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT                     13

     Music assaults us. Bass so heavy, it jars our teeth. We're in
     a seedy sex playground, under harsh neon lights. Strippers on
     stage, on poles, in cages...Most of them high on drugs, empty
     eyes, bored. "Coyote Girls" in string bikinis, servicing
     tourists, all sweating like fiends...

     He turns and scans the crowd till he spots a young Thai
     girl...NINA, 20's, bikini clad...giving a lap dance to a mid-
     60's CUSTOMER.

     To Billy, Nina is impossibly beautiful, an angel, a rose. His
     anger builds, as the Customer paws Nina's breasts and legs.

     Nina looks up from her Customer, and sees Billy watching her.
     Eyes meet...Billy forces a smile...Nina nods to a booth where
     two YOUNG AUSTRALIAN MEN (20's) nervously wait.

     Billy slams another whiskey, then--

     bloodied bandage...as he counts out two packets of 100 Yaba,
     wrapped in cling film.

     Australians hand Billy cash. Billy counts, pockets it. Gives
     them the pills.

     Then Australians #1/#2 watch as Billy cooks up a hit of Yaba.

     ...and the SEQUENCE BUILDS, Billy hustling deals...Yaba for
     cash, deal after deal. Getting HIGHER with customers. Getting
     HIGHER alone, in between SHOTS OF WHISKEY and BUMPS OF COKE.
     The music gets LOUDER. The action HEAVIER. More NARCOTIC...

     A very intoxicated Billy throws water on his face. He shadow-
     boxes a few punches in front of a filthy mirror...then stares
     at his reflection, morosely.

     other girls. THE MUSIC DEAFENING NOW -- We cannot hear what's

     Billy heads over. Nina sees his condition and stands up.

     Billy tries to talk to her. Nina rejects him.

     Billy takes her by the arm and pulls her close.

     is obliterated, sweating profusely as he walks through the
     club...Only the hardest sex/drug addicts remain. Billy's legs
     buckle; he uses a wall for support, sparks a JOINT to slow his
     heart.

     His distorted POV.....A Stripper slides a cigar from her vagina
     and pumps out smoke rings. Men applaud, hurl cash on stage.

     Billy blinks, unsure if he's hallucinating.

     Everything rising to a fever pitch. Then, without warning...
     SOUND CUTS OUT...and Billy starts to weep.

     Billy is, by now, paralytic. Mouth open, head tilted back,

     muted heart beat...

     He spins, looks at his table --

     It's full of EIGHT YABA PACKETS, burned matches, a pipe.

     He looks at his desk -- it's covered with WEAPONS: a Colt .45,
     machete, a stun gun, knuckle duster, a pile of cell phones/sim
     cards, and a Samurai sword.

     Fuck.

     Yaba packets hit the floor, plastic burned by intestinal

     A few others in the cell take notice: ADDICTS, sweating,

     Guards look around. Prisoners/Billy are still. NO ONE MOVES.
     The ring-tone keep playing.

     Then, Skinny Guard looks at a naked Thai (NOK, 20) and orders

     blanket, as they carry him away.

     Prisoners roll up their blankets. Billy does the same.

41   TIMECUT. Water begins pumping from a black pipe and fills up    41
     a plastic barrel. Billy watches as other PRISONERS quickly
     grab large, plastic lemonade bottles from a pile in the
     corner and fill them up with water.

     Billy, still sitting there, hears someone giggle...He looks
     over to see a mentally retarded Thai inmate, filthy, in moldy
     flip-flops, (NOI, 19) watching him...Laughing. Noi is the
     only other prisoner not trying to get water.

     Now, Billy gets up and hurries in to get water. It's rowdy,
     chaotic: NUMEROUS PRISONERS all yelling in Thai, forcing
     their way in to fill up their bottles.

     Billy gestures/talks. No one understands him.

     Billy finally manages to fill up three bottles for himself.

     He looks around at the other prisoners, inches apart.

     BILLY'S POV: Some are asleep. Most in bad health: open sores,
     diseases. Tiffany snores beside him. One prisoner mumbles to
     himself, incoherent. Another cries quietly, his foot badly
     infected with gangrene. A third prisoner makes a crude weapon
     out of a SPOON. An OLDER PRISONER sits on the toilet steps,

     Billy, saying nothing...

     using makeshift rigs out of Bic pens to boot heroin.

</b>     watches, nervous and horrified as Kiaw builds a "syringe":
     taking apart a Bic pen, then using a lighter to burn/melt one
     end of the stem around a needle;

     As Kiaw breaks open a straw of heroin and mixes it with water
     in a bottle cap...

     Kiaw sucks the heroin mix up through the "syringe," then
     forces the needle into his vein, and blows the heroin in;

     Billy is shocked.

     A DESK GUARD sits, reading a newspaper.

     BILLY'S FACE as he edges forward, transfixed. Everything

Billy, rattlesnake strike, grabs Trustee #3's head and slams
it into the wall -- plaster splits -- startling us. Billy
snaps a hard right-left across #3's snout, blood sprays.

And all hell breaks loose.

Prisoners yell and scatter. Trustee #3 screams, cups his
nose, gushing. Trustee #4 and another, #5, grapple with Billy.

Billy breaks loose and sinks his TEETH into #4's throat.
Blood spurts, #4 howls. Billy bites down even harder. Even by
his own brutal standards, it's shocking.

Trustee #5 chops away at Billy's head, who takes the pain.
Trustee #4 collapses. Billy hurls Trustee #5 to the floor.

A WHISTLE blows in the distance. Blood is everywhere: On
Billy's clothes/face/mouth. He looks at the injured Trustees,
smiles bloody teeth, crazed and raises both middle fingers.

The Trustees w/batons look at the Trustees that are injured.
They see the blood, then the bite marks.

Trustee #6 turns to Billy and grins.

     it slams open. Two TRUSTEES throw Billy on his face, like a
     sack of raw meat. Trustees go back inside...

     Billy rolls to his back, leaving a blood mask on the ground.

     Billy lies there...bloody and swollen. Eyes, purple slits.
     The sun beating down on him, flies nipping at him, barely
     able to breathe...

     Then, a YOUNG WOMAN approaches, blocking out the sun. Early
     20's. A paige-boy hair cut. We see her in SILHOUETTE...

     The Woman gently dabs Billy's wounds with a wet rag, cleaning
     the blood. When she leans closer, her FACE comes into light.

     Her name is JOM.

     And she's a man...in bright red lipstick.

<b>                           JOM

     Jom sits Billy up, continuing to nurse him. After a moment,
     she helps Billy get to his feet.

     Billy holds onto Jom for support...step-by-painful-step,
     slowly making their way toward a looming ADMIN. BUILDING in
     the center of this fenced-in compound.

     Suddenly GUARDS #1 and #2 arrive, and shout at Jom in Thai.

     Jom shouts back. Arguing ensues. She's protecting Billy.

     crack eggs, scramble, pour, flip and fold them. The stoves
     are electric. PRISONERS wait in line for omelets, then move
     to a gallery of lawn chairs and eat.

<b>     BILLY + KIAW
</b>     sit on buckets, using toothbrushes to scrub their ankles
     beneath their shackles. Their eyes are hollow, black circles
     from weeks of abuse. Track marks visible.

     Billy scrubs roughly...His ankle starts to bleed. He keeps
     scrubbing.

     Suddenly the sound of HUNDREDS OF PRISONERS WHISTLING, making
     CAT-CALLS in Thai. Billy and Kiaw look up --

     Jom -- in a long wig and makeup -- is being escorted through
     the yard by TRUSTEES. She swings her hips with exaggerated
     sexiness, like a peacock flaunting it's feathers.

     Billy is surprised at how attractive she looks.

     Jom sees Billy, waves and calls out to him:

<b>                          JOM
</b>               Hey, farang ba! You think me
               beautiful?

     Billy just watches. No words.

     Jom enters a shop with an encaged window for protection. The
     Trustees lock her in. Ready for business...

<b>73   EXT. PRISON SHOP AREA: COURTYARD - DAY - BILLY                   73

     is trying to find cigarettes from one of the shops and stands.
     It's loud, unruly: DOZENS OF PRISONERS all bargaining,
     arguing, shoving at once.

     Billy gestures over the noise. Every SHOP OWNER refuses him.

<b>     ANGLE, JOM
</b>     behind the counter of a CAGED-IN SHOP. She's selling
     cigarettes, toiletries, coffee, homemade Valentine cards, etc,
     along with May and Char.

Deep in the crowd, Jom sees Billy -- frustrated, vulnerable.
Billy notices Jom watching, and works his way toward her.

<b>                    JOM
</b>              (smiles, flirtatious)
          Hello. How I can help you?

Billy, getting bumped on all sides, tries to hold ground.

<b>                    BILLY

Jom looks at him.

</b>               (lying)
          -- I'm expecting some cash from me

Jom regards him, then opens her ACCOUNT BOOK.

She writes down Billy's name with a baht amount.

<b>                    JOM
</b>          I give you fifty dollar credit. Pay
          me back when you can?

Billy nods, embarrassed.

Jom slides him a CARTON OF CIGARETTES.

          -- I never thanked you for fixin'

Billy nods "thanks."

     Billy's uncomfortable. VERY uncomfortable. So Jom just smiles
     and then he leaves. Jom watches him go.

     is hunched under a blanket. He cuts two lines of heroin on a
     bucket. Billy SNORTS one line, quickly switches nostrils,
     SNIFFS the other, both barrels.

     Billy's eyes press shut, to ESCAPE, for a moment. SILENCE...
     precious silence...

     Billy lifts an edge of the blanket, peers out: Thin Samurai
     sits there, smoking a cigarette, watching him.

     AMBIENT SOUND/REALITY...SELF-HATRED comes back;

     Thin Samurai smiles, puts the cigarette out on his tongue.
     Then he eats it.

     Billy just looks at him. Then --

     REVEAL NOW, across the cell...the YOUNG SAMURAI w/tattooed
     hands. His head is bowed as Keng uses the CROOKED KNIFE we
     saw earlier to shave Young Samurai's scalp...Slowly,
     methodically...hair falls in bits, revealing Young Samurai's
     scalp is full tattooed with the image of a DRAGON.

     Billy watches this ritual, nightmarish and surreal --

     is alone at the bars. Arms slung over the crossbars, smoking
     a cigarette. Quiet, sullen.

     It's DAWN - faint Buddhist and Muslim CHANTING O.C.

     Kiaw hides a handful of heroin straws in a SHAMPOO BOTTLE.
     Billy notices. Kiaw looks at him, smiles.

     Billy picks up the carton of cigarettes. Only one pack left.
     When he opens it, he finds a small NOTE tucked inside between
     cigarettes. Billy mumbles low, as he reads --

<b>                          BILLY
</b>                   (to himself)

     At the bottom of the note, a lipstick mark. Signed: "Jom"

     Billy's jaw tenses. Silent. Disturbed.

     Then, we hear the sound of MEN RUNNING. A lot of men. Billy
     looks up: THE MUAY THAI BOXING TEAM is doing wind sprints in
     the yard. Back and forth, powerful as horses, no one out
     there but them.

     Billy watches. One man coaching, looks up: NAN, smoking a
     cigarette. Eyes meet.

     And as the team keeps running...

     The chanting grows louder... Louder... Fearful... CUT TO:

     peers through the bars to get a glimpse of what's happening.

     We HEAR distant mayhem. Batons hitting flesh. Men screaming
     insanely.

     Billy turns to see all of the Samurai sitting in silence.
     Cross-legged, waiting. Only Keng looks at Billy...and
     gestures for him to stay quiet.

     The sound of beatings/screaming intensifies as the raid gets
     closer to their cell.

     Billy tries to swallow his fear, but it's impossible.

     We begin hearing FOOTSTEPS somewhere. Lots of them. Coming
     hard and fast. HEAVY KEYS jangling.

     Billy steps back.

     He blinks.

     A few Samurai protest/spit back -- Dogs bark and bite them --
     Guards kick and punch them -- smashing batons across Samurai
     bare backs with relentless force.

     Billy sees another Samurai being dragged out by the hair.

     Contraband hits the floor: cell phones, chargers, pocket
     knives, spikes, shivs, drug paraphernalia, porn mags;

     the ENTIRE PRISONER POPULATION stand in rows, nude, their

     their shorts/underwear are pulled to their ankles.

<b>     SILENCE IS DEAFENING. BRIGHT LIGHTS FLOOD THE YARD.

     GUARDS body-search the prisoners one by one, then search
     their clothes. The dead bodies of Elyias, Trustees #1 + #2
     displayed for all to see.

     Billy sees Nan and the Boxing Team amongst prisoners, also
     nude. Nan doesn't notice Billy.

     Then, TRUSTEES push Jom, May and Char to a distant corner,
     wearing bras and panties. For the first time, we see Jom
     without any makeup on.

     She looks at Billy, his pale, naked body amongst tattooed
     Samurai. Jom stares...Billy looks away...it's awkward.

<b>     OFFICER PI SIT

     prisoners' faces, a cold anger in his eyes...

     A paranoid Kiaw VERY SUBTLY kicks his shirt on the ground in
     front of Billy...but Billy doesn't notice.

     The Guards are getting closer, roughly searching prisoners
     and their clothes.

     THEN Bull Guard arrives/searches Billy: mouth, ears, feet,
     balls, armpits, ass.

     Bull Guard grabs Kiaw's shirt off the ground (thinking they
     are Billy's). Billy SEES they aren't his...

     Bull Guard folds back the seam of Kiaw's shirt: REVEALING A
     HIDDEN POCKET stitched inside.

     Billy glances at Kiaw in disbelief...Kiaw just stares ahead.

     Bull Guard rips the pocket out, finds: STRAWS OF HEROIN --
     then shouts in Thai to Officer Pi Sit.

     Officer Pi Sit walks over. Takes the heroin. Bites open one
     straw, tastes the powder.

     Officer Pi Sit glares at Billy.

     Kiaw says something in Thai. Bull Guard shouts angrily back.
     Kiaw talks/gestures to Billy -- says the heroin is his;

     Billy shakes his head "no," frantic, terror stricken. Officer
     Pi Sit just keeps staring at him.

     As Bull Guard shouts in Thai, Billy snatches the shirt from
     his hands and tries to put it on.

     Too small. Doesn't fit. A SLEEVE rips, then hangs off.

     Bull Guard goes silent. Officer Pi Sit looks at Billy and
     Kiaw. A VERY SCARY, VERY INTENSE MOMENT.....

     Officer Pi Sit turns, signals sharply to the Trustees.

     IN A FLASH, the Trustees grab Kiaw and fiercely hurry him out
     of the yard.

     Kiaw protests, frantic-- as Billy watches, shackled, still.

     Trustees wrestle Kiaw to an upstairs office and shut the door.

     There's a sudden SQUALL OF FEEDBACK over the LOUD SPEAKERS,

     and smoking cigarettes. Billy is high, among them.

     The antechamber is connected to a small cell. And behind
     those bars: a dressed up Jom is singing Karaoke. May and Char
     sing back-up, lyrics roll on a shitty tv, as Jom sings into a
     microphone. It's a slow, very seductive Thai BALLAD...

<b>     BILLY
</b>     his eyes glazed, watching Jom through the smoke...as do all
     the other inmates. The room pulses slowly. Billy is totally
     captivated by Jom's singing and stares without blinking.

     Jom looks right at Billy, as if singing just for him. With
     the effects of the drugs -- DREAMLIKE, SURREAL -- Jom becomes
     emotional as she sings, appearing like a star...an angel...

     For Billy, forgetting the prison surroundings for just this
     moment, he's trancelike...mesmerized...as if he and Jom are
     alone. Even the cell bars disappear;

     When the song ends, Billy continues watching Jom and everyone

     yanks the shirt off Billy's face.

     Billy's mouth is wide, eyes rolled back. Looks like a corpse.

     Bull Guard lifts Billy's head, shakes it. Then harder. Billy
     is totally limp.

     Bull Guard gives him a VIOLENT KICK to the ribs. Billy's eyes

     onto a stool before a STEEL MESH PARTITION.

     Billy almost falls over. Bull Guard sits him up straight.
     Billy is badly disheveled, bloodshot eyes, grey skin,
     unshaven, beyond high. To his left and right, PRISONERS shout
     back and forth to VISITORS on the opposite side -- ten feet
     apart -- divided by bars/mesh. A BABY cries. It's madness.
     Like talking across a freeway.

     BILLY'S POV swims for a moment to an OUT OF FOCUS VISITOR
     seated on the other side of the mesh...

     As Billy blinks, strains to see, the Visitor comes INTO FOCUS
     revealing: NINDAM (the young boy from the opening scene.)

     He stares at Billy in shock. Shock of his decay. Shock of time
     gone by.

     Billy looking back, his bloodshot eyes moving down to:

     BILLY'S POV -- NINDAM'S HANDS, holding a small TROPHY. He
     grips it nervously, speaking slow and distinct; unsure if
     Billy understands:

<b>                         NINDAM

     Billy tries to respond. Strains to focus...Can't.

     Then, Nindam sadly sets an OLD GYM BAG on the divider:
     Billy's gym bag.

     letter in pencil.

     We see GLIMPSES of his crude, childlike handwriting:

     Bull Guard signals Billy to sit on the floor.

Pi Sit doesn't move.

     Billy's hand is on the counter. Jom watches his expression as
     she reaches through the bars, slowly...and lays her hand on
     his. The tips of her fingers brush Billy's scarred knuckles,
     lightly back and forth.

     He's uncomfortable, and slides his hand back.

<b>                         JOM
</b>               I believe you.

     She gives him a CARTON OF CIGARETTES, then discreetly hands
     him another LOVE NOTE. Billy pockets it.
<b>                                                                49.

     through the heat and congested yard. He grips the cigarette
     carton in one hand, his old gym bag in the other.

     He pulls Jom's note from his pocket, throws it away without
     reading it.

     Then Billy looks, walks with steely determination toward --

     comes down hard. Billy yanks his hand back...It's Nan.

     Billy holds up the carton of cigarettes. Says intensely:

<b>                         BILLY
</b>               Let me train, and they're yours.

<b>     BEAT. HOLD. THEN:

     Nan draws back the gate. Takes the cigarettes. Billy enters.

     work out. It's very loud. Desk Guard in the corner.

<b>     BILLY
</b>     stands ringside, and wraps his own hands. Nan lights a
     cigarette and watches as Billy pulls a small jar of Vaseline
     from his gym bag and greases up his face, then inserts his
     old mouthpiece and bites down. Last, he pulls out his old
     boxing gloves (worn in, blood-stained).

     Billy puts them on, looks to Nan to lace them.

     As Nan laces Billy's gloves, he sees the SCARS on Billy's arm
     and looks at him. Billy says nothing. Nan finishes tying the
     gloves.

     Billy climbs into the ring, THROUGH the ropes...and waits.

Nan looks around the gym at all the BOXERS training. He
gestures to one: LEK (20's) -- lean, tattooed, much smaller
than Billy -- to get in the ring.

Billy, dead staring, watches as Lek steps OVER the ropes and
moves to a corner...

There's a moment. A LONG one.

<b>                    NAN
</b>          Chok!(fight)

Billy charges out fast. Lek feels his aggression and starts
to circle.

Billy attacks and Lek nails him with a front kick to the
chest. Billy takes it, then fires a punch. Blocked. A leg
kick. Blocked. Lek snaps Billy's head back with a jab. Then
again. And again.

Then a HUGE KICK to the jaw -- THAT HITS WITH THE IMPACT OF A
TRUCK -- Billy goes down in a heap.

He shakes it off, clears his head. Other Boxers stop what
they're doing and watch as Billy picks himself up, fire in
his eyes...and goes after Lek with a vengeance --

Within moments, Lek is throwing and battering Billy like a
rag doll. Pounding him at will, with solid PUNCHES and KICKS
that knock Billy to the canvas over and over.

Billy keeps getting up...But the harder he retaliates, the
harder he gets hurt.

Nan, ringside, stoically smokes cigarettes, as --

Finally, Lek grabs the back of Billy's head, hauls it down
and launches knee after knee after knee into Billy's ribs.

Billy goes down hard. He slowly gets up. Balance wavers. Then
he turns and VOMITS over the top rope;

Humiliated.

Nan nods to Lek, who then exits the ring.

Billy looks up at all the Boxers talking in Thai, joking and
laughing about Billy.

He exits the ring...Nan removes the gloves, saying nothing.

An assistant trainer, TANE (45) approaches with a MOP and
BUCKET on wheels. He points to Billy's puke with disdain.

      Billy mops the floor.

      The Boxers resume training.

      When Billy finishes, he shoves the gate back, and leaves.

      He takes the ice pack off, revealing bad facial damage: Black

      He runs a finger inside his mouth, spits blood on the ground.

      Billy sets the ice-pack on the back of his neck, and hangs

      Bull Guard shouts something in Thai at Billy.

      Billy doesn't understand;

      Bull Guard then shouts at Keng and a few others in Thai ("Who
      fucked this guy up?! He looks like shit, who did this?!")

      is in line behind three other Boxers in the ring. Across from
      them, stands a ripped powerful fighter: PON (28).

      One at a time, each Boxer challenges Pon to grappling combat,
      until one of them is thrown to the floor.

      Billy watches as Pon destroys each opponent with astonishing
      speed and strength.

      Then, it's Billy's turn.

      Pon grins and waves him forth.

      Billy moves in and --

</b>      slam into a clinch. Working hard, Billy takes the brunt of
      the pain. He pushes Pon, the stronger man, toward the
      ropes...They grapple aggressively. Then, Pon picks up Billy
      and tosses him 180 degrees with his power.

      Billy hits the canvas like a rag doll. Stunned.

      Pon just laughs...He's extremely dangerous.

      THE BOXING TEAM jogs past. Billy watches them go...Then,

      Billy struggles to keep pace, huffing and puffing. But then
      he realizes...he's jogging through areas of the prison that
      he's never seen...

One Guard pulls out shackles. The other, a baton.

Billy sighs and exits the ring. The Guards remove his gloves.
Nan just watching, then...

...As Officer Pi Sit angrily walks over to the Desk Guard,
talks firm, Nan walks over and talks to Pi Sit in private.

The Guards roughly cut off Billy's handwraps as he watches
Nan and Officer Pi Sit talk in the distance.

<b>WE/BILLY CANNOT HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING OVER THE ROAR OF

      Songkran. The gym is crowded with Guards and Officer Pi Sit,
      who supervises.

      Outside the gym gate: DOZENS OF PRISONERS have gathered to
      watch, deciding who they'll bet on. Among them, are the
<b>      SAMURAI.
</b>
      Pon makes weight: 175

      Next, Billy steps on. Pi Sit leans in to read Billy's weight:
      210 lbs. (about 35 lbs overweight)

<b>                          BILLY
</b>                The fuck? Is the scale broke?

      Billy looks down: Someone else's foot is on the scale: Pon.
      He grins, malevolent.

      Billy heels Pon's leg off.

      Officer Pi Sit watches without expression.

      On the verge of erupting...Billy gets off the scale, Nan
      resets, and Billy gets back on.

      Pon inches up behind...blows in Billy's ear, then whispers
      something we can't hear.

      Billy makes weight: 175

      Then, he reels and throws a punch that doesn't land, because
      they're separated. Shouting. Pushing. The entire team now,
      the Guards-- CUT OUT;

<b>116   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - PRISONERS                          116

      ON STAGE, with A LADY-BOY BAND, Black Dildo wears a long wig,
      performs a romantic Thai song.

      Prisoners and Guards are mixing, eating, dancing to music,
      throwing water in all directions and laughing. Everyone in
      high spirits...

      OUT OF THE DARKNESS OF THE GYM, Billy and the boxing team
      emerge, carrying the RING out to the sunlit yard, where they
      set it down. THE SOUND OF A CELEBRATION FILLS THE AIR....

      Billy stand with Lek, watching, in disbelief.
<b>                                                                 60.
</b>

      Then, a prisoner runs by and hurls A BUCKET OF WATER on
      Billy. He's soaked, freezing. Lek starts laughing, as--

<b>      ANGLE, THE BUDDHA STATUE
</b>      Two Prisoners on stools pour flowered water over it, as
      others pray, light incense and candles.

<b>      A LINE OF BUDDHIST MONKS
</b>      young and old, in bright orange robes, move through the yard,
      as the far as the eye can see.

      Billy SEES Prisoners and Guards flock to the Monks, kneeling,
      making offerings of fruit and ornaments.

      In return, the Monks give blessings, sprinkling sacred water
      with a stick on the prisoners' hands and faces...

<b>      ANGLE, A YOUNG MONK
</b>      that summons Billy forth.

      Billy hesitates, then steps closer. The Young Monk smiles and
      applies the sprinkles Billy's face. He doesn't know what it
      means. Doesn't need to. It feels peaceful. AND AS MUSIC
      CARRIES OVER...for the first time, Billy smiles.

      WIDEN. THE WHOLE YARD IS CELEBRATING. Only the ring is empty.
      Then, Black Dildo voice booms over the microphone:

      We SEE the FEAR on Billy's face.

      As the REFEREE (a Guard) tries to revive him, he sharply
      signals to Billy that he fights next.

      Lek exits the ring, pats Billy's shoulder and smiles,
      encouraging him.

      Billy looks to the crowd: Everyone from Songkran going crazy,
      gambling. Keng and Samurai betting big on Pon. In the front
      row: is Officer Pi Sit, arms folded, watching stoically.

      JOM, in a short skirt and high heels, walks the ring w/a CARD

      Pon GRINDS HIS GLOVE into Billy's ear. Blood and white cells
      pour. It's hard to watch.

      Billy reacts and fires a three-punch flurry that lands, then
      Pon steps over and hammers a hook to Billy's exposed kidney.

      Billy drops to one knee, air leaves him, pain engulfing him.

      signals Billy to rise....

      ....and he does. A split-second, and Pon charges. Billy
      blocks A RAGE OF PON'S HEAD SHOTS and KNEES, doing his best
      to cover. A FIST SLAMS through Billy's guard, like a shotgun.

      Billy comes off the rope and hits Pon with a vicious three-
      shot combo, right-left-right. WHAM-WHAM-WHAM. Feints. Then a
      solid OVERHAND RIGHT that BREAKS the bridge of Pon's nose.

      THE BELL. The Ref pulls them apart. Billy throws Pon a crazed

      his mouthpiece...

      Pon launches a short right that Billy counters with a BIG

      A HARD RIGHT CROSS SLAMS HOME on Pon's face -- knocking him
      to the canvas with a HEAVY THUD, out cold.

      No need to count. The Ref waves it over, removes Pon's
      mouthpiece: it's a bloody mess.

      The Crowd erupts. The Samurai, staring, simmering. Officer Pi
      Sit, in disbelief. Pon lays unconscious, as Cornermen try to
      revive him.

him.

      ...Then, suddenly, Billy discovers Nan, Lek and the ENTIRE

      Billy runs among the them...He sees a rapist Samurai, naked,
      hands tied behind his back, being forced to roll in the yard,
      while getting kicked and humiliated by Guards.

      Billy looks up at the Sector 5 Cell, sees the rest of the

      conducting a sacred Sak Yant tattoo ritual.

      It's EXTREMELY HOT, EXTREMELY INTENSE. Lek and two Boxers
      hold Billy down, as another: TIGER uses a 40cm long needle
      (the "Mai Sak") to apply the ink onto Billy's back with fast,
      repeated jabs....the image of a LEAPING TIGER beginning...

      Billy fights the pain, holding it in;

      The boxers invoke a deep, hypnotic mantra (the "Kata"), some
      clutching amulet fragments, the chanting becomes ONE VOICE...

      CU's. Billy's pores, needle scraping ink made of snake venom,
      and jabbing. Lek wipes blood off Billy's back, revealing the
      Leaping Tiger and SAK YANT tattoos forming.

      Billy's eyes roll back, the mantra inducing a trance state.
      As Nan blows into the tattoo, the Boxers become shadows,
      silhouettes...The cell walls fading. All we see is Billy. All
      we hear is chanting...

      Billy watches the swirl of activity from a distance.

      shop, selling wares...engaging with prisoners.

      Billy stares for a moment...then keeps walking.

      Near the medical hatch, Jom is talking to a MUSCULAR TRUSTEE,
      fanning herself with a Chinese fan and flirting.

      She notices Billy-- glancing over, then ignores him and
      struts toward the other Boxers, as if an audience:

smiles;

</b>          My only regret is I should have had

can't keep from watching Jom deliberately feign affection for
Muscular Trustee.

For Billy, the tension rises to a boiling point.

      among the entire Boxing Team, and Football Team, as they
      kneel for Buddhist Evening Prayer ("Suad Mon Yen"). Chanting
      fills the cell, and Billy watches them, isolated and apart.
      His thoughts elsewhere.

      THREE MORE HARD SHOTS from Lek hit Billy clean, and he
      bounces off the ropes.

      Lek looks over at Nan, who is standing on the ring apron,
      watching: Billy is NOT throwing back.

      Billy takes a kick to the chest. Then another. Lek gives an
      imploring look, then fires a series of PUNCHES; Billy just
      takes it, refusing to cover.

      Lek knees his ribs, and Billy slumps forward into a clinch.

      Lek shoves Billy off, paws with a jab...concerned. Suddenly,
      Billy dips and CRASHES A HOOK ON LEK'S JAW -- stunning him.

      As Lek staggers, Billy unleashes FOUR DEVASTATING PUNCHES AND
<b>      LEK IS BADLY HURT.

      SILENCE falls over the gym.

      Billy is shocked at what he's done. So is Nan, as he quickly
      goes to Lek's aid.

      Billy storms out of the ring, rips off his gloves with his
      teeth, then slams them in a trash bin and leaves...

      Desk Guard hurries after him.

      The rest of the Boxers, confused, watch Billy go.

      Billy pounds the wall with his fist. Slow, heavy thuds, that
      come one after another.

      Billy pumps out sit-ups.

      Billy does furious push-ups.

      Noi watches Billy, giggling. Billy stops and looks at him.

      Billy does push-ups with Noi on his back.

      Guards enter, drop off food, then lock the bars again.

      Billy and Noi sit/eat together. Noi smiles. Billy smiles back.

      Prisoners' clothes hang on a wire. Billy rips it down and
      uses it as a jump rope.

      As he does, Billy's eyes glaze over, somewhere else.

      Billy/Cellmates sleep, inches apart. Noi right next to Billy.

      Guards enter again. Drop off food. Shut the bars.

      In back of the cell/shower, Billy helps Noi bathe. Then dries
      him off with a towel.

      Later, Billy stands with a DULL RAZOR and starts to shave his
      own head. Intense expression on his face;

      All the prisoners watch in ominous silence.

      A few drops of blood stream down the back of Billy's scalp
      and neck.

      His head now shaved, he now shaves off his eyebrows...leaving
      the skin underneath beaded in blood.

      Guards bring in food; shut the bars.

      Billy starts shadowboxing. FIRING COMBOS that get faster and
      harder -- More and more violent...

      The other prisoners move back, nervous, afraid -- Except Noi.

      Billy keeps punching, pivoting, attacking...dripping with
      sweat. The combos coming with blazing force and speed --

      Billy finally stops, drops to his knees. Noi applauds, his
      eyebrows shaved as well.

      Noi gives Billy water, smiles.

      There's a sound of the door opening and a figure walks in:

      It's Billy...released from punishment. Brought in by Desk
      Guard.

      Everyone stares. Billy tries to gather courage as he walks up
      to Nan.

      There's a long moment before he speaks:

      Then, Nan hands Billy a pair of BOXING SHORTS. Billy looks

      Noi, a huge smile...He removes his flip-flops, gives them

      quickly away, singing a Thai song loudly and out of tune.

      Billy inspects items: coffee, shaving cream, soup cans...They
      agree on the flip=flops that Noi likes.

      As Noi tries them on, Billy then moves to a row of feminine
      items: lipstick, eye shadow, a woman's headband with a
      plastic flower attached.

      He looks up at the Old Man watching him.

      Noi looks at Billy, concerned. Hopes it's not for him. Shakes
      his head, "no."

      Billy is amused.

      There's a sound. Billy turns;

      Billy stares at her in silence. Emotion roiling through him.
      They look at each for a long, unspoken moment.

      Then Jom steps back and begins to perform the Ram Muay dance.
      Billy watches, transfixed as she teaches. It's strange and
      spiritual. Her movements graceful, yet surprisingly powerful.

      Now, Billy tries, following Jom's lead. Back and forth...She
      guides him along, together...both moving like water.

      Billy is under attack in seconds.

      Diesel firing in punches. Billy bounces off the ropes just as
      Diesel strikes with a flying knee that CRASHES into Billy's

      OUT from under him.

</b>
      TEXT ON SCREEN: After serving three years, Billy Moore was
      transferred to a UK prison and released on an amnesty by the
      King of Thailand in October 2010.

      Upon his return, he reconnected with his family.

      With the help of Narcotics Anonymous, Billy remains clean to
      this day, and works with other addicts who are in recovery.

      Now, a smile comes to Mr. Moore's face.

      Across from him, REVEAL: sits Billy.

      They look at each other for a LONG MOMENT, in deep silence.
      Emotion is palpable between them.

      Then, Billy smiles to his father.
