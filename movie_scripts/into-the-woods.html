</b>           Once upon a time, in a far off
           kingdom, there lay a small village at
           the edge of the woods...

          Suddenly, the WELL-WORN BOOT of Cinderella steps into the
          frame and lands on what we thought was the sky, but in fact
          is simply its reflection in a puddle of water. A strong CHORD
          accents the splash and we begin a musical vamp.

          The BAKER and his WIFE are cleaning up after their day's
          work. There is an unexpected knock at the door. They stare at
          one another momentarily.

<b>                          BAKER

          The DOOR pops off its frame and goes flying across the room
          in a giant puff of smoke. The BAKER and his WIFE scream and
          cower in a corner.
          As the fog clears, we see the WITCH for the first time and
          she's not a pretty sight. MICE and other vermin drop from
          beneath her cape and scatter through the cottage.

<b>                          WIFE
</b>           We have no bread.

           wish.
          She moves towards the WIFE as the BAKER tries unsuccessfully
          to protect her. She points her gross finger towards her
          belly.

           lovely neighbors. You see, your mother
           was with child and she developed an
           unusual appetite. She admired my

</b>          The wind now blowing the willow tree, its LEAVES begin to
          rain down on CINDERELLA, turning gold and silver as they
          swirl around her, transforming her clothes into a beautiful
          gown.
          CINDERELLA looks down to see that she is now wearing a pair
          of shoes literally made of gold leaf. When she looks back up,
          the tree has now returned to its former shape.

          LRRH walks along the path.

<b>           BAKER (V.O.)
</b>           On her path to Granny's, the little
           girl suddenly found herself in a very
           unusual part of the wood.

<b>                         WOLF'S POV
</b>          Branches and leaves rush by in a blur. Suddenly, the CAMERA
          stops, and in the distance we see LRRH strolling down a path
          of exotic flowers as she munches on a treat. We hear HEAVY
          BREATHING. The CAMERA continues stalking its prey, moving
          closer towards LRRH through the brush.
          ANGLE on LRRH, as she continues walking and eating.

<b>           WOLF (O.S.)
</b>           Good day, young lady.
          She turns around and what she sees - through a CHILD'S EYES -
          is a super-slick, good-looking guy. What she doesn't notice
          is his curiously low hairline, something of a snout, and a
          tail peeking from his waistcoat.

          LRRH goes about her business picking flowers further from her
          path.
          ANGLE ON THE BAKER who has been observing LRRH from a
          distance. Like a bat, the WITCH swings upside down from a
          tree above the BAKER:

<b>                          WITCH

           asked you in the first place? I'm not
           allowed to touch any of the objects!
          We suddenly hear the lilting sound of a young voice singing
          in the distance. The WITCH, almost intoxicated by her sound,
          swoons with delight. Then:

</b>           This is ridiculous!
          ANOTHER ANGLE. LRRH is picking flowers off the path, blithely
          unaware of anything else. The BAKER gets up and hurries over
          to her.

           get that beautiful cape?

<b>                          LRRH

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           May I take a look at it?
          He quickly unties it.

</b>           Please -- give it back!
          They have a tug of war.
          The BAKER pulls free and runs off with the cape. LRRH stands
          there momentarily stunned, then lets out a loud scream.
          ANGLE ON THE BAKER. He stops cold, realizing what he's done,
          then runs back to LRRH and places the cape around her
          shoulders.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure
           that you really loved this cape. Now
           off you go to Granny's -- and be
           careful that no wolf comes your way.

<b>                          LRRH
</b>           I would rather a wolf than you any
           day.
          LRRH stamps on his foot. The BAKER hops on his good foot.

          The WIFE steps out from behind a thicket.

<b>                          WIFE

<b>           BAKER (V.O.)
</b>           The first night of the festival ball
           brought Cinderella her wish. The
           Prince danced only with her, `til he
           turned and she had slipped away.
          Suddenly CINDERELLA in her ball-gown rushes out of a back
          entrance and onto the terrace disappearing around a corner.

<b>          ANOTHER ANGLE - THE STEPS
</b>          She descends a long stretch of ancient stone steps that lead
          to the outside grounds.

<b>          ANOTHER ANGLE - CONTINUOUS
</b>          She appears running down a garden path below and into the
          woods. A beat later, CINDERELLA'S PRINCE, dashes out on to a
          drawbridge where he spots CINDERELLA below. He is tall, dark
          and impossibly handsome. His STEWARD and other attendants
          join him.

<b>                          C'S PRINCE
</b>           I must find that girl!

<b>          EXT. WOODS - PATHWAY TO THE CASTLE - NIGHT
</b>
          The BAKER'S WIFE is trying to find her way back to the
          village, pulling an obstinate MILKY-WHITE on a leash behind
          her. We see a piece of the castle in the distance.
          We TRACK CINDERELLA racing through the brush -- not an easy
          feat in a ball gown and gold slippers. We hear VOICES in the
          distance and the NEIGHING OF HORSES. CINDERELLA stumbles on a
          knoll, loses her footing and rolls over and over to the
          bottom landing with a spectacular THUD just yards from the

<b>          WIFE.
</b>
<b>                          WIFE
</b>           Are you alright, miss?

<b>                          CINDERELLA
</b>
<b>                          (STARTLED)
</b>           Yes. I just need to catch my breath.

<b>                          WIFE
</b>           What a beautiful gown you're wearing.
           Were you at the King's Festival?
          CINDERELLA, preoccupied, collects herself so she can continue
          on her way.

<b>                          CINDERELLA
</b>           Yes.

<b>                          WIFE
</b>           Aren't you the lucky one. Why ever are
           you in the woods at this hour?
          We hear the PRINCE'S ENTOURAGE approaching.

<b>                          37
</b>

</b>           This way!

<b>                          CINDERELLA
</b>           Please. Don't let them know I'm here.
          She quickly hides herself in the brush. The WIFE turns around
          and looks to the top of the rise to see C-PRINCE on a black
          stallion, with his STEWARD and ATTENDANTS in tow. He calls
          down to the WIFE.

<b>                          C'S PRINCE
</b>           Have you seen a beautiful young woman
           in a ball gown pass through?

<b>                          WIFE
</b>           (Breathless as she

<b>                          BOWS)
</b>           I don't think so, sir.

<b>                          STEWARD

</b>           If I may, my lord, I think I see her
           over there.
          The ENTOURAGE races off and CINDERELLA reappears and sits,
          catching her breath.

<b>                          WIFE
</b>           I've never lied to royalty before.
           I've never anything to royalty before!

          The WIFE goes after CINDERELLA but then hears a distant COW
          MOAN. She turns around to discover that MILKY-WHITE has taken
          off.

          The WIFE takes off after the cow as the CAMERA RISES above
          tree level. The BLUE SHADOW has moved a little further across
          the face of the MOON.

          A STRAGGLY ROOSTER crowing, the sun cutting across its path.

</b>
          JACK'S MOTHER is woken by the rooster crow to find something
          ticking her nose.
          She opens her eyes, brushing the "something" away -- then
          sees that it's a huge LEAF pushing in through an open slat in
          the wall.

<b>          EXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAYBREAK - EXTREME WIDE SHOT
</b>
          The cottage, now dwarfed by a giant BEANSTALK. JACK'S MOTHER,
          a tiny figure from this distance, comes running out of the
          house, takes one look at the giant plant and screams.

<b>          EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - DAY
</b>
          Various angles of JACK, running feverishly through the woods
          in search of the BAKER. He carries a huge sack of LARGE-SIZED
          COINS over his back. He occasionally calls out: "Mr. Baker!"
          The BAKER, peacefully asleep is curled up in a large root,
          clutching the red cape like it was his blankie. Suddenly JACK
          leaps from atop calling his name and waking him.

<b>                          JACK
</b>           Let's go find them!
          JACK grabs the BAKER and excitedly tries to pull him along.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           Wait a minute! I'm not sure I want to
           sell.

<b>                          JACK
</b>           But you said I could buy her back. Do
           you want more money?

</b>           Wait. I didn't say--
          But JACK doesn't wait to listen. Taking the EMPTY SACK, he
          runs off excitedly.

          The BAKER follows after JACK and collides into his WIFE,
          dropping his satchel and revealing the red cape. He hides the
          money sack.

<b>                          BAKER

          With a grand sweep of her cape, the WITCH throws off dirt and
          muck over the BAKER and the BAKER'S WIFE as she disappears
          into a cloud of dust.
          The BAKER wipes dirt from his mouth.

          WIDE SHOT. We hear the hoofbeats of horses coming from both
          directions. Crossing the frame and each other are
          CINDERELLA'S PRINCE on his BLACK stallion and RAPUNZEL'S
          PRINCE on his WHITE steed. They pass out of the frame. After
          a few beats, they return trotting, meeting in the middle.

<b>                          R'S PRINCE

          In the background we see the WIFE, who has wandered by on her
          way back home. She stops to EAVESDROP on the PRINCES.

<b>                          R'S PRINCE

           has no door or stairs.

<b>                          C'S PRINCE
</b>           Where?

<b>                          R'S PRINCE
</b>           Two leagues from here, due east, just

<b>                          R'S PRINCE
</b>           I stand beneath her tower and say,
           "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your
           hair to me." And then she lowers the
           longest, most beautiful head of hair -
           yellow as corn - which I climb.
          The WIFE is thrilled by this news, and runs off.

<b>          EXT. RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - NIGHT
</b>
          The BAKER'S WIFE fights her way through a thicket. Her
          clothes are now ratty, her face scratched - but she
          approaches the tower with trepidation.

<b>                          WIFE

           to me.
          The window at the top of the tower opens and RAPUNZEL sticks
          out her head looking downward. The WIFE hides to the side.

<b>                          RAPUNZEL

          RAPUNZEL thinks about it for a moment, then lowers her hair.
          The WIFE approaches it gingerly.

<b>                          WIFE (CONT'D)
</b>           Excuse me for this.
          She takes a fist full of hair and gives it a pull. Nothing.
          She tries once again, this time with more force eliciting a
          little yelp from RAPUNZEL. Finally, she holds on to the hair
          and just starts running away from the tower as fast as she
          can. We hear RAPUNZEL yell as the WIFE succeeds in pulling
          some of the hair from her head.

</b>           As the Baker's Wife bolted from the

           festival was thrown into chaos when
           Cinderella once again ran from the
           Prince.
          While the BAKER'S WIFE continues to run away from Rapunzel's
          tower, in the distance she sees a flutter of gold moving
          through the moonlit trees. CINDERELLA? She changes course in
          pursuit.
          SERIES OF SHOTS with MUSIC
          CLOSE-UP on CINDERELLA'S SHOES as they make their way through
          wooded path.
          ANGLE ON THE WIFE as she races towards them in pursuit.
          The WIFE catches up with CINDERELLA and tackles her to the
          ground, CINDERELLA'S slipper falling off. They both dive for
          the slipper, when an approaching noise catches the WIFE'S
          attention.

<b>           C'S PRINCE (O.S.)
</b>           Over here!
          CLOSE-UP on the shoe as CINDERELLA snatches it from the
          ground. CINDERELLA rushes off.
          The WIFE stares frozen in horror as the PRINCE'S HORSE races
          towards her. She lets out a scream and the horse stops short,
          rearing up. The STEWARD'S horse charges off the path into
          thickets.

<b>           C'S PRINCE (CONT'D)

</b>           Well, what are you waiting for? See if
           you can find her.
          The STEWARD rides off. The PRINCE pauses. The ultimate
          seducer, he gives the WIFE the once over.

<b>           C'S PRINCE (CONT'D)

          opening in the base of a huge tree.
          We can hear the STEPSISTERS bickering, their blonde hair
          bobbing animatedly.

</b>          The BAKER stands in the middle of the pathway, flagging down
          the carriage. He pulls an ear of corn from his satchel. As
          the carriage slows, he hops on the sideboard.

          backwards into the brush.
          The CARRIAGE speeds off. Deflated, the BAKER picks himself
          off the path and sits on what he thinks is a white rock.
          There is a muffled "Moo..." He jumps up realizing he's been
          SITTING on the cow.

<b>           BAKER (V.O.)
</b>           When dawn broke, the Baker and his

          Once he has reached the bottom, she pulls her hair back in
          and closes the window.
          ANOTHER ANGLE. We discover that it's the WITCH who has been
          watching. She is not happy.
          The PRINCE mounts his horse and rides off towards a low rose
          thicket -- an easy jump.
          With a thrust of her stick, the WITCH makes the thicket shoot
          up before the PRINCE has time to act. His HORSE stops short
          and he screams as he is thrown over the horse's head into the
          thicket.
          ANGLE ON THE WITCH. She smiles at her handiwork then turns to
          stare at the top of the tower vindictively.

          To frantic MUSIC, JACK is making his way down to the bottom
          of the beanstalk with all the speed he can muster. This is
          made more difficult by the GOLDEN HARP which he has slung
          over his shoulder.

           before he knew it, found himself
           fleeing from a Giant.
          Suddenly, the BEANSTALK shakes mightily, making JACK hold on
          for dear life. He looks up to discover the Giant climbing
          down after him; Jack feverishly picks up speed and jumps the
          last six feet to the ground. He quickly drops the harp and
          runs to a large axe embedded in the stump of a tree.
          JACK swings the AXE striking the BEANSTALK.

          The BAKER and his WIFE start to go off in opposite directions
          when there is a TREMENDOUS CRASH with the force of an
          earthquake. The BAKER and his WIFE are knocked off their feet
          and tumble into a bank of FERNS. They scramble to their feet

          The entire STEPFAMILY has assembled, in various stages of
          undress. LUCINDA stands and watches as the STEPMOTHER tries
          to force FLORINDA'S large foot into the tiny slipper.

          Standing lanterns have been set up outside the house, bathing
          the area in light.
          The STEPFAMILY watches as the STEWARD helps FLORINDA up on to
          the back of the Prince's horse. In pain, she grits her teeth
          in a frozen smile.

           Prince's horse, unaware of the blood
           dripping from the slipper.
          As the STEWARD steps back, he notices a tiny speck of blood
          on his white glove. He looks up to the PRINCE to show him his
          hand. The PRINCE looks back to FLORINDA who shrugs
          sheepishly.

</b>           Minus a heel, Lucinda did her best to
           swallow the pain.
          At last, LUCINDA appears, masking her pain with a smile, and
          limps towards the PRINCE. She is followed by her MOTHER and

          LUCINDA winks at the PRINCE flirtatiously, then promptly
          faints to the ground with a thud. The shoe falls from her
          foot. The PRINCE nods to the STEWARD who walks over and
          gingerly picks up the bloody slipper.

          Out of the shadows, CINDERELLA appears.
          The STEWARD hands the slipper to the Prince, who kneels down
          in front of CINDERELLA and easily slips it on her foot.

          The PRINCE sweeps CINDERELLA off her feet and leads her to
          his horse. The two of them ride off.
          FLORINDA and LUCINDA watch, not at all happy. Then they hear
          a CAWING (the sound of birds) overhead. They look up,
          alarmed.
          BIRD'S POV. Far below, FLORINDA and LUCINDA cower together,

          CAWING rising to a crescendo until their flapping wings are
          all we see.

          RAPUNZEL is alone in a mossy bower on an isolated island in
          the middle of swamp waters filled with POISONOUS SNAKES. She
          hums a sad refrain.

          ANOTHER ANGLE. The R-PRINCE with a ragged scarf wrapped
          around his now blinded eyes, sits slumped over on his horse
          as the animal navigates its way through the marshy expanse.

          the sound as the R-PRINCE calls her name.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           What?
          JACK grabs the ear of corn out of the BAKER'S hand.

<b>                          JACK
</b>           You can use the silky hair of the corn--

           to the cow. Quickly!
          The BAKER grabs the ear of corn from JACK, pulls the hair
          from the corn and feeds it to the cow.
          JACK begins milking the cow again. We hear the distant CHIMES
          OF MIDNIGHT begin.
          Light pours from above bathing them in a growing haze of BLUE
          LIGHT as the SHADOW finally eclipses the MOON. The COW lets
          out a BLOODCURDLING MOAN.

<b>                          WIFE

<b>                          WITCH
</b>           At last!
          The WITCH drinks the potion. She begins to shake. Blue smoke
          begins to pour from her and swirl about as if she is trapped
          inside a cloud. The WIFE lets out a shriek..
          The BAKER looks at his WIFE, her belly begins to grow to nine-
          months-full of pregnancy.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           That was quick!
          The cloud that has surrounded the WITCH now engulfs the area
          until a brisk wind blows it away, revealing a beautiful woman
          standing in the BLUE LIGHT of the FULL MOON. The WITCH has
          been restored to her former self, and she likes what she
          sees.
          The final CHIME OF MIDNIGHT is joined by every other BELL IN

          GOLDEN ROSE PETALS fill the air, swirling across the screen.
          PULLING BACK we see that the petals are being thrown by
          CHEERING SUBJECTS who toss more into the air as they clamor
          to catch a glimpse of CINDERELLA and her PRINCE on their
          wedding day.
          MUSIC. CINDERELLA'S carriage resplendent in gold drawn by
          black stallions passes. She sits demurely smiling as her
          PRINCE plays to the PASSERS-BY. This comes easily to him.

           succeeded in reversing her mother's
           curse. Cinderella finally stopped
           running from her Prince.
          CINDERELLA'S POV on the crowd.
          She sees JACK and his MOTHER waving; JACK'S MOTHER is over-
          dressed in brand new clothes including a ridiculous
          "fascinator" hat.

<b>           BAKER (V.O.)
</b>           Jack was reunited with his beloved cow
           and his mother could now dress in the

          Cinderella now sees the BAKER and his WIFE standing amongst
          the crowd, the WIFE holding their new BABY BOY.

<b>           BAKER (V.O.)
</b>           And the Baker and his Wife were proud
           parents of a strapping baby boy.
          The WIFE shows her the BABY.

           Thanks for the slipper.
          The carriage arrives at the entrance to the castle. As the
          PRINCE and CINDERELLA step from their carriage they are met
          by cheers.
          The STEPFAMILY awaits the married couple. The beaming
          STEPMOTHER with her DAUGHTERS who are now wearing dark
          glasses, holding canes and looking rather glum.
          RAPUNZEL stands with her PRINCE.
          The CROWD ROARS as CINDERELLA and her PRINCE wave.
          The STEWARD takes up a large speaking trumpet and the CROWD
          quiets.

          CINDERELLA and her PRINCE (mid-kiss), along with their
          ATTENDANTS and the entire CROWD to the ground. A piece of the
          CASTLE comes CRASHING DOWN. Chaos ensues.
          JACK'S MOTHER stands up and looks around. No sign of JACK.

          ANGLE ON RAPUNZEL. She is spooked by the commotion and runs
          off through the crowd and disappears.

          The R-PRINCE searches the crowd for RAPUNZEL. Those who
          haven't fled, quiet and gather around. The C-PRINCE takes the

           As many of you know, we had another
           little shaker just days ago. I will
           personally investigate the

<b>          EXT. KINGDOM - DAY

          A dense mist settles across the kingdom. In the distance a
          beanstalk stretches up to the sky. C'S PRINCE and his RETINUE
          gallop away from the destroyed castle into the woods.

</b>           But as they made their way back into
           the woods, their familiar paths were
           nowhere to be found and their lives
           were about to take an unexpected turn.

<b>          EXT. WOODS - FLOWERED PATH - DAY
</b>
          The BAKER and his WIFE are walking down a path -- or the
          remnants of a path.

<b>                          WIFE
</b>           What's happened? Everything's so
           different.
          They discover LRRH sitting on her suitcase in what was once a
          lush area, now trampled and broken.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           Hello, little one. Are you alright?
           What are you doing here? With a
           suitcase?

<b>                          LRRH
</b>           I'm moving in with Granny. Our whole
           village collapsed. I couldn't find my
           mother anywhere. And now I can't find
           my Granny's cottage.

<b>                          BAKER

<b>                          LRRH

           recognize anything. There was no path.

           Where's the stream? Where's the
           bridge? Where's Granny?

</b>           Calm down.

<b>                          BAKER

           the path.

<b>                          WIFE
</b>           Yes.
          The WIFE is exhausted. She hands the BABY to the BAKER.

<b>                          WIFE (CONT'D)
</b>           Please take him for a few moments.
          The BAKER is clearly uncomfortable holding the BABY. They
          continue walking. The BABY begins to cry.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           Why does he always cry when I hold
           him?

          The BABY wails. The BAKER hands the bundle back.

<b>                          BAKER

          Through a thick haze, the BAKER sees the STEWARD, the
          STEPFAMILY and a few SERVANTS carrying trunks and tending to
          the blind, hobbling STEPSISTERS.
          The BAKER makes his way to them with his WIFE and LRRH in
          tow.

          LRRH takes her hand.
          But then the ground begins to shake. A frightening and
          increasingly loud crunching noise. They fight for their
          footing.
          The STEPFAMILY drop their belongings and rush to each other.
          The BAKER puts his arm around his WIFE.
          Everyone's faces fill with terror as a huge shadow engulfs

          The WITCH, who has slipped in behind the group, comes forward
          startling everyone and moves directly to the GIANT.

          LRRH races past the WITCH and brandishes her knife.

<b>                          LRRH
</b>           It was you who destroyed our house -

          A great bellow that makes the trees shake.

          looking up and discovering the GIANT.

<b>                          STEWARD

          The GIANT suddenly reaches down. They all quickly duck out of
          the way.
          JACK'S MOTHER runs forward to confront the GIANT.

<b>                          JACK'S MOTHER
</b>           Jack is just a lad! We had no food to

           exchange for magic beans.

<b>                          GIANT
</b>           The boy - I want the boy!

</b>           I'm waiting!
          They all lose their balance. The STEWARD uses his staff to
          hold JACK'S MOTHER back, trying to silence her.

<b>                          STEWARD

          She stops. An ominous expression crosses her face. We begin
          to hear the pounding steps of the GIANT moving closer. The
          WIFE scrambles up a steep incline trying to find a way to get
          out of the GIANT'S path. She makes it to the top, but
          realizes there is no way down on the other side.
          As the GIANT'S footsteps near, the WIFE is engulfed in
          darkness. Trees begin to fall around her and as the earth
          shakes, she loses her balance and falls backwards with a
          scream.

          something. He goes over and picks up his SCARF.

          The BAKER turns to look at his FATHER, but he is gone. Was he
          ever there?
          The BAKER walks angrily along an overgrown path through the
          woods. He slows, sits down on a tree stump and breaks down,
          his wife's scarf in his hands.
          Slowly he calms himself.

<b>          GIANT.
</b>
<b>                          LRRH
</b>           Here she comes!

<b>          ANGLE ON JACK AND THE BAKER.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           Go, Jack! Be careful.

<b>          ANGLE ON THE GIANT'S FEET
</b>          Destroying everything in its path.
          ANGLE ON JACK, as he scurries up higher in the tree.

<b>                          105

<b>                         WIDE SHOT
</b>          The GIANT approaches LRRH and CINDERELLA.

<b>                          GIANT
</b>           Where is the boy?

<b>                          LRRH
</b>           We have him.

<b>                          GIANT
</b>           Where?

<b>                          LRRH
</b>
<b>                          (POINTS)
</b>           He's hiding in that tree!
          JACK pops up and reveals himself at the top of the tree.

<b>                          JACK
</b>           Here I am!
          The GIANT begins to move aggressively towards JACK.
          JACK and the BAKER load their slings.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           (calling up to JACK)
           Ready?

<b>                          JACK
</b>           Ready!
          ANGLE on the GIANT'S feet, trampling everything in her path.
          Suddenly, she steps into the expanse of the tar pit, which
          slowly stops her in her tracks. She fights to free herself as
          she begins to sink.

<b>          SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>          -- The BIRDS fly from the trees.
          -- BAKER'S POV through the tree branches as the BIRDS swarm
          around the head of the GIANT.
          -- CINDERELLA and LRRH watch and hear the GIANT'S screams.

<b>                          CINDERELLA
</b>           Good birds!

<b>                          LRRH
</b>           She doesn't look happy.
          -- the BAKER and JACK use their slings to fire stones at the

<b>          GIANT.
</b>          -- JACK shimmies to the end of a high limb for better aim.
          -- The GIANT reaches blindly towards JACK.

<b>                          LRRH (CONT'D)
</b>           Look out Jack!
          -- The GIANT seizes hold of the branch where JACK is standing
          which knocks JACK off. JACK catches himself on the way down,
          grabbing the branch, and hangs on for dear life. Using one
          hand, JACK whirls his sling and delivers a knock-out blow to
          the GIANT'S forehead.
          -- The GIANT reacts and begins to sway.
          BAKER'S POV of the GIANT'S eye as she fall towards him.
          The GIANT'S hand grabs some tree branches, as she fights for
          her balance. We hear the crackling branches as the GIANT
          FALLS pulling the tree down with her, snapping it in a final
          deafening THUD.

<b>          EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          CINDERELLA and LRRH run around the gigantic, exposed roots.

<b>                          CINDERELLA
</b>           Where are they?

<b>                          LRRH

<b>                          CINDERELLA

<b>                          (TO LRRH)
</b>           Will you take him.
          LRRH takes the BABY as CINDERELLA helps JACK out of the tree
          roots.

<b>                          CINDERELLA
</b>           Oh, be careful, are you alright?

<b>                          JACK

<b>                          LRRH

          All three feverishly look for him.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           Jack, I'm here.
          CINDERELLA helps JACK lift the tree branch as the BAKER,
          breathless, crawls out from beneath its grasp. He is
          scratched up, but relieved. CINDERELLA takes the BABY from

<b>          LRRH.
</b>
<b>                          CINDERELLA
</b>           Let me take him.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           (To Jack then LRRH)
           Are you okay? Are you alright? We did
           it! We did it! Come here.
          They embrace the BAKER. There's a moment of realization of
          what just happened as they look up at the roots of the fallen
          tree.

                         

<b>                          BAKER (CONT'D)
</b>           Now we can all return home.

<b>                          JACK
</b>           What home? I have no one to take care
           of me.

<b>                          LRRH
</b>           (to the BAKER)
           And we have nowhere to go, so we'll
           move in with you.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>
<b>                          WELL --

<b>                          BAKER (CONT'D)
</b>           -- of course you can come home with
           me.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           If you want to.

<b>                          CINDERELLA
</b>           I'll gladly help you with your house.
           There are times when I actually enjoy
           cleaning.

<b>                          108
</b>
                         
          The BABY begins to whimper. The BAKER walks towards
          CINDERELLA and his SON.

<b>                          BAKER
</b>           Here -- give him to me.
          The BAKER walks away from the group, trying to settle his
          SON. He wraps his SCARF around the BABY.

<b>                          BAKER (CONT'D)
</b>           (to the BABY)
           Hey, hey, hey, come on now. Hey,
           please, come on, come on, it's okay. I
           know you miss your mother.
          The BAKER sits on a fallen tree trunk.

<b>                          BAKER (CONT'D)
</b>           I miss her too.
          The BABY cries.

<b>                          BAKER (CONT'D)
</b>           Sssh!
          The BABY still cries.

<b>                          BAKER (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>           MAYBE I JUST WASN'T MEANT TO HAVE
</b>
<b>                          CHILDREN--
</b>          The BAKER hears his WIFE'S voice. We see her over his
          shoulder.

<b>                          WIFE
</b>
<b>           DON'T SAY THAT!/ OF COURSE YOU WERE

<b>           YES, CALM THE CHILD.

<b>                          BAKER

          As the Baker holds his son close, the baby begins to calm
          down for the first time in his father's arms and his WIFE
          disappears.
          The BAKER tells the story to his son -- THE SAME STORY AS WE

<b>          HEARD AT THE BEGINNING.
</b>
<b>           BAKER (CONT'D) WITCH (V.O.)

          LRRH, JACK, and CINDERELLA join the BAKER.

<b>           WITCH (V.O.)

<b>           CAREFUL BEFORE YOU SAY,/ "LISTEN TO

<b>           ME."/ CHILDREN WILL LISTEN.
</b>          The light of the new dawn streams down on them, framing the
          newly formed family. As the BAKER continues to tell the story
          the CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS UP overhead to reveal the vast woods,
          now changed by the Giant's path.
          The CAMERA then carries us back beyond the woods and to the
          Village where we see the destruction that has visited it.

          The CAMERA finally pans up from the Village to the sky and we
          are returned to where we began: the grey clouds of an early
          morning sky.
