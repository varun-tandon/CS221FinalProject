     CAMERA (STEADICAM) follows behind JIM KURRING.  He walks through 
     a courtyard, past some young mexican and black kids playing,
     up a staircase and arrives at a door that is half open;

                      Some neighbors called said they

                      you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna
                      become that you've been up to something.

                      answers: I'm gonna assume that some
                      mischief has been goin' on here. 

<b>                                MARCIE

</b>                      It's ten o'clock in the morning -- 

     There's a small THUMP noise OC. Jim turns his head quick and
     looks and Marcie freezes. 

<b>                                JIM KURRING
</b>                      --- What was that?

</b>                      I didn't hear anything.

     Marcie stands up.

<b>                                JIM KURRING 
</b>                      No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit

</b>                      I don't have to do a god damn thing. 

     Kurring gets his handcuffs out and handcuffs her wrist to the
     couch, she goes crazy, screaming and yelling the whole time;

<b>                                MARCIE

                      and don't do this. I want you to stay -- 

     Continue with that until he's got her cuffed to the couch. 
     He removes his REVOLVER from his holster and starts to move
     slowly down the hall to the back bedroom -- 

<b>                                MARCIE

</b>                      This is the LAPD. If anyone is

     Kurring moves into the BEDROOM now and sees that the CLOSET is
     closed and probably the only place for someone to be hiding;

<b>                                JIM KURRING

                      and If I Have To Open That Closet 
                      you will get shot -- Step Out Now. 

     Jim inches towards the closet, flips it open real quick and
     stands back, ready for something to jump out -- nothing. 

<b>                                MARCIE

     Jim looks down the hall at <u>Marcie who has physically dragged</u>
     <u>the large couch handcuffed behind her</u>; 

<b>                                JIM KURRING

<b>     JIM'S POV, CAMERA DOLLIES IN SLOWLY TOWARDS THE CLOSET. 
</b>     He pushes some sheets aside and burries around to reveal: 

     A DEAD SKINNY WHITE MAN (50s) curled up in a ball on the 
     floor of the closet.  He'd dead and he's been covered in dirty
     laundry.  He has a gag around his mouth.

     HOLD on Jim for a moment, he panics a little and swings his REVOLVER
     towards Marcie:

     <u>INT. EARL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY</u>

     Earl in bed, pretty out of it, but once in a while a couple clear
     moments.  Phil sits next to the bed, paper and coffee nearby.

     REVERSE, THAT MOMENT. The crowd of fifty GUYS who are taking the 
     "Seduce and Destroy Seminar" that Frank is teaching today laugh and
     play along; 

     Frank is on a slightly elevated stage.  vBehind him a huge banner for,
     "Seduce and Destroy," whose logo is a scared pussycat and a large wolf
     with a big buldge in his fur.  It reads: "No Pussy Has Nine Lives". 

<b>                                FRANK

                      Take it on, head first -- with your 
                      skills at work and say, "No.  You will
                      not control me.  You will not take my
                      soul and you will not win this game."
                      'cause it is a game, guys, you wanna 
                      think it's not -- go back to the schoolyard
                      and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect 
                      the cock -- you are embedding this thought:
                      I'm in charge.  I'm the one who says yes, 
                      no, now or here.  Shit, man.  Sad but true.
                      Sad But True.  And you wanna know what?
                      It must be the way. 
                      The thing about chicks and the thing
                      about this course that we're going 
                      through today is how <u>universal</u> the whole 
                      thing is.  I mean: I wish I could sit here 
                      and say that it's not -- because <u>the reality</u>?
                      If each chick had something new, something
                      really new that I'd never seen before? 
                      Fuckin' hell: I'd be in the money!  Because 
                      I'd have to create a hundred new cassettes,
                      a hundred new books, a hundred new seminars 
                      and hundred new videos just to deal with each
                      and every situation a chick could create - 
                      but that is just not the case.  They are universal.
                      They are sheep. They are to be studied and 
                      watched -- they have patterns that must be stopped,
                      interupted and resisted. I'd be makin' a fuckin'
                      butt load if they were actually as much of 
                      a challenge as they want you to think they are!
                      Reality: They Are All The Same. 
                      Each and every one of them.  And once you learn 
                      these methods: You're Set.  You Don't Have To Come Back.
                      That's it. In solid. Boom.  Done.  Over.  Why?
                      Because all women are the same.  Period. 
                      End of discussion.  Sorry.  It's true.  Sad But True.
                      And anyone who wants to say that these methods
                      we work by are "unfair?"  Yes, they are.
                      Guilty as charged.  And so's the world. 
                      It's a harsh, hard unfair place, but it's not 
                      gonna stop me from getting my fair shair of hair pie --

                      Denise when we put our calendars to work and

                      "By the end of May, you will know I'm not gay."
                      "On the fourth of June, Denise, you're
                      gonna be lickin' my spoon."
                      "And Come August, You Suck My Big Fat
                      Sausage."  I've SET GOALS FOR MYSELF.
                      And what?  I've said "enough is enough."
                      Because why?  She's not gonna be your pal.
                      She's not gonna be your friend.  You think
                      she's gonna be there for you the second
                      you need something?  Think again - this fuckin'

                      all need women as friends, 'cause we're gonna 
                      learn later on in Chapter 23 that having a couple
                      of chick-friends laying around can come in
                      real handy in setting Jealousy Traps. 
                      But we'll get to that.  Number One (this is page 18

</b>                      I can't believe I'm telling you guys this, 
                      but the truly terrifying part is that: THIS WORKS.
                      Any girl that calls herself your friend is not
                      gonna let you be alone in a situation like that.
                      Technique #2: Staging a fight. 
                      This is not knock down, drag out, crying
                      screaming, yelling -- this is a simple, 
                      direct and subtle way of planting confusion
                      into a girl's mind.  Remember we are using 
                      reinforcement technique "G" with these women.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      This is the way...because they will
                      always wonder, "What did I do?" 
                      "What could I have done different?" 
                      "How should I behave to get this back?"
                      And if they think that way -- then they
                      are asking for you to hurt them and 
                      That Is What You Must Do.  That is what
                      you must do which is punish them many,
                      many times over.

                      can take the pain away that he is in,
                      there is a very strong and very potent solution
                      of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle,
                      with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in
                      his mouth and drop on his tounge and 
                      it will certainly diminish the pain that
                      he is in but you have to realize that
                      once you give it to him; there really 
                      is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly
                      cure his pain, but he will float in and 
                      out of consciousness, even worse than he
                      is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the 
                      recognizable Earl will pretty much go away -- 

<b>                                LINDA 
</b>                      -- how the fuck can I say anything 
                      to that -- I don't know what to say to that --

                      try and make it as painless as possible.
                      Right?  You understand?

     She sits up a bit, covers herself, looks past him and sees the
     Middle Aged Guy, sitting in his underwear in the living room,
     watching them.  She looks back to Jimmy;

     Captain Muffy hands Frank a cigarette, lights it for him.

     VIDEO CAMERA'S POV - It's zooms in to close up of Frank.  He exhales;

     <u>EXT. SMILING PEANUT BAR - THAT MOMENT</u>

     CAMERA BOOMS DOWN and PUSHES IN on Donnie Smith's Honda Accord,
     with damaged front end, as it pulls into a parking space.
     It's POURING RAIN. (dir.note) 

     CAMERA lands in close.  Donnie sits a moment.  He plays his tape,
     "Dreams," sings along a bit, pep talks himself, does some deep 
     breathing, says; 

<b>                                DONNIE 
</b>                      Make it happen, make it happen and go,go,go.

     <u>INT. SMILING PEANUT BAR - THAT MOMENT</u>

     CAMERA (STEADICAM) pushes in as Donnie enters this dark little bar.
     It's not too crowded.  He takes off his wet coat, brushes his hair 
     back a bit and walks to an empty corner table --

     Donnie takes his seat and looks over to the bar -- CAMERA swings a 180,
     heads away from him -- it moves to the bar area and into:

     A young, handsome BARTENDER BRAD (20s) is pouring drinks.

     CAMERA picks up with a COCKTAIL WAITRESS (30s) who walks over and 
     brings us back to Donnie's booth -- 

<b>                                COCKTAIL WAITRESS 
</b>                      Hello.  You're back again, huh?

<b>                                DONNIE

     She exits.  Donnie lights a cigarette -- CAMERA blends from 24fps 
     to 40fps -- he looks across the room -- CAMERA swings 180 back towards
     the bar and pushes in towards -- 

     Bartender Brad takes the order from the Cocktail Waitress. 
     He nods, turns from her and smiles to reveal <u>a full set of BRACES</u>. 

     ANGLE, DONNIE.  CAMERA pushes in slow and he smiles, touches his
     hand to his mouth.

     DONNIE'S POV - The Bartender pours the coke, turns his attention towards
     an old-freaky looking Thurston Howell/Truman Capote/Dorothy Parker 
     type guy (60s) at the end of the bar, who raises his glass, motions as
     if to say, "Another one of these, please," while waving some money
     and smiling/flirting with Brad the Bartender. 

     Donnie's face drops.  CAMERA DOLLIES back a little bit and blends from
     40fps to 24fps.  The Cocktail Waitress arrives back; 

<b>                                COCKTAIL WAITRESS

     Donnie GLARES across the bar at BRAD and THURSTON as they flirt.

     They arrive and enter onto the stage -- CAMERA swings around, branches
     away from them and BOOMS UP to reveal the set; 

     There is a LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE that's being settled into their seats.

     It's a three-camera set up with a FLOOR DIRECTOR roaming around,
     shouting orders, etc.

     There's a spot for the announcer, an old-pro named DICK JENNINGS (60s)
     Dick is in the middle of doing bad-comedy warm up for the studio
     audience.  He's had a few drinks, etc. 

     The STAGE itself is a cross between JEAPORDY/NEWLEYWED GAME/PRICE IS
     RIGHT.  There's a podium for Jimmy Gator.  One panel holds "The Kids,"
     and one panel holds, "The Adults."  There are chaser-lights all around
     and some of the design feels left over from the early days of the show.

     CAMERA hangs out with the KIDS as they are ushered into their panel,
     which at this moment faces away from the audience and is behind a
     curtain.  Julia turns her head, sees something:

     The ADULT CHALLENGERS are brought out by an assistant type and loaded
     into their panel.  The Adult Challengers are:

     Black woman named MIM MacNEAL(40s) 
     White guy with glasses TODD GERONIMO (20s)
     Puerto Rican guy named LUIS GUZMAN (40s) 

     The Adults give a couple small glares over to the Kids.

     the holster and it FALLS straight to the floor, slides down the steps. 

     Claudia turns the music down, turns back and sees that he is gone.

     Jim Kurring grabs his billy club from the bottom of the steps and
     bounces back up and into the apartment as if nothing happend;

                      movie where the guy is trying to get
                      ahold of the long-lost son, but this 
                      is that scene.  Y'know?  I think they 
                      have those scenes in movies because they're
                      true, because they really happen. 
                      And you gotta believe me: This is really
                      happening.  I mean, I can give you my
                      phone number and you can call me back 
                      if you wanna check with whoever you can check 
                      this with, but don't leave me hanging on this --
                      please -- please.  See: See: 
                      See this is the scene of the movie where
                      you help me out --

     Frank and Gwenovier doing the interview, CAMERA DOLLIES IN SLOW ON EACH:

</b>                      -- see, I thought you grew up here
                      in the valley --

<b>                                FRANK 
</b>                      Like I said, yeah -- 

<b>                                GWEN 
</b>                      And you went to Van Nuys High, right? 

<b>                                FRANK 
</b>                      I don't how much I went -- but I was
                      enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. 
                      I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat.
                      Not even close to what I am today. 
                      Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk
                      to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as
                      opposed to I <u>wanted</u>. 

<b>                                GWEN 
</b>                      Where does that name come from? 

<b>                                FRANK 
</b>                      What name?  My name? 

<b>                                GWEN 
</b>                      It's not your given name, right? 

<b>                                FRANK 
</b>                      My mother's name, actually. 
                      Good question.  You've done you're research. 

<b>                                GWEN
</b>                      And "Frank?"

<b>                                FRANK 
</b>                      "Frank" was my mother's father. 

<b>                                GWEN 
</b>                      Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating
                      your school records at Berkely and UCLA.
                      Your name change -- they had no official
                      enrollment -- 

<b>                                FRANK 
</b>                      Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't -- 

<b>                                GWEN
</b>                      They wouldn't?

<b>                                FRANK 
</b>                      no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't
                      officialy enrolled, that's right.
                      Was that unclear? 

<b>                                GWEN
</b>                      Kind of.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                      I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood:
                      My enrollment was totally unoffical because
                      I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up 
                      there.  But there were three wonderful men
                      who were kind enough to let me sit in on
                      their classes, and they're names are: 
                      Macready, Horn and Langtree among others.
                      I was completely independent financially,
                      and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. 
                      So what we're looking at here is a true
                      rags to riches story and I think that's 
                      what most people respond to in "Seduce,"
                      And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not 
                      even be about picking up chicks and sticking your
                      cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be
                      In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and 
                      saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen 
                      to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck-
                      why-not?  he.he.he.

                       can tame, and it's all in vain to call it,

     and sees a pot of coffee.

</b>                      got some coffee brewing, huh?

<b>                                JIM KURRING 
</b>                      I like iced coffee, generally, but a day
                      like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --

</b>                      You take cream or sugar? 

<b>                                JIM KURRING 
</b>                      That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say,
                      so I can get my role of LAPD officer
                      out of the way before we enjoy our 
                      coffee (I never like to talk shop over coffee)
                      I'm not gonna write you up or anything,
                      I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- 
                      but the real problem we have is that there
                      are people around here, people that 
                      work from their homes, people tryin' to get
                      some work done, and if you're listenin' to 
                      your music that loud:  They're incovenienced
                      by that.  If you had a job you'd probably
                      understand, but I see you like listenin' 
                      to your music and that's fine, you're just 
                      gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume,
                      maybe memorize what number you see on the
                      dial and just always put it to that -- 
                      If it's the middle of the day -- that's 
                      what I do -- just put it on two and a half 
                      and that's a good listening level, alright? 
                      I see you like listenin' to your music loud,
                      but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you
                      end up damaging your own ears ok?

                      about it early, if and when the police
                      call and come for help.  Now there

</b>                      -- that's right, that's right, and what I'M 
                      saying, that none of my competitors can say is
                      this:  That there is no need for insight or
                      understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done.
                      Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is?
                      How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and
                      ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm 
                      talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u>
                      as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is
                      no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for
                      UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take 
                      <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other
                      words -- all the terrible shit or all the 
                      great shit that you've had happen to you in 
                      your life -- and quickly and easily transform
                      it in the unconscious mind through the subtle 
                      and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"
                      (in other words: The Chick) settles into a very
                      light, very delicate, conversationally induced
                      state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. 
                      A state that is brand new.  The System's state.
                      What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put 
                      it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use.
                      I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the 
                      seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 
                      'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that
                      will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --

</b>                      Kids, Adults, I'd like you to put
                      yourself at a picnic.  Place yourself
                      there with your family and friends
                      if you'd like -- you'll hear three
                      musical notes and you are to tell me
                      what it might represent that you'd
                      find at a picnic -- The First Three Notes:

     OC we hear three musical notes.  The "Adults" panel lights up,
     Todd answers;

<b>                                TODD
</b>                      Well, Jimmy, I know this, I have perfect
                      pitch, you see -- and that would be A-D-E.
                      And that would represent lemonade.

<b>                                JIMMY
</b>                      For 250.  Next notes, please:

     OC musical notes: E-G-G.

                                TODD (buzzes)
                      Got it.  That's E-G-G which would be ~egg."

     Richard and Julia glance at Stanley, like "why the fuck aren't you
     answering these questions?" He looks straight ahead. 

<b>                                JIMMY
</b>                      For 500 and the Third Set Of Notes:

     OC musical notes: B-E-E.

                      B-E-E -- and don't get stung.

     The "Adults" are now within 200 points of the "Kids," on the scoreboard.

     <u>INT. GAME SHOW STAGE - THAT MOMENT</u>

     Three MEN in TUXEDOS and HARMONICAS have taken a place near
     the band.  Jimmy, reading from his cards, introduces them and
     asks the following question: 

     (Note: Jimmy's speech is starting to slur a bit more at this 
     point.  His motor skills seem to be fading quickly.)

<b>                                JIMMY 
</b>                      Imagine you are attending a jam session
                      of classical composers and they have 
                      each done an arrangment of the classic 
                      favorite, "Whispering."  Here are three 
                      variations on the theme, as three classic 
                      composer's might have written it -- you are
                      to name the composer.  The First: 

     The Harmonica Fella's play an arrangment....CAMERA pushes in close
     on STANLEY and TITLS DOWN CLOSE TO HIS PANTS....

     Stanley begins to piss his pants.  He trembles and shakes and 
     holds back tears as the wet stain gets bigger.

     OC through this we hear the Adults answer the question:

<b>                                TODD (OC)
</b>                      Well, Jimmy that sounded to me
                      like Brahms, a bit like his Hungarian
                      Dance Number Six, I believe. 

<b>                                JIMMY (OC) 
</b>                      Excellent. Next number:

     The Harmonica Fella's play another arrangment of "Whispering"
     that sounds like Ravel's "Bolero."

     Stanley moves his arms down to his sides to cover his crotch 
     and pull at his pants -- <u>and his BUZZER goes off with a brush</u>
     <u>of the side of his arm</u> -- 

<b>                                JIMMY

     at him and see his pants and they start to laugh a bit.

                      and all this but I think I'd be a fool

                      married...but I cheated on her...over and

     He's reading a book.  BEAT, HOLD, THEN:

     CAMERA pans/dollies away and booms up -- moving across the
     restaraunt -- across the way, sitting in a booth by the opposite 
     window, out of view from Stanley;

     Dixon, the little kid from earlier, sitting in a booth with a
     young black male, WORM (20s) This is clearly the back figure
     we've been seeing glimpses of --

<b>     ANGLE, AT THE BOOTH.
</b>     Dixon eats same pudding.  Worm mumbles to him, various jabs.
     "...sit up straight..." "...world is hard..." "..little brat..."

     HOLD.  Worm glances across the coffee shop -- he sees Stanley.

     Worm HOLDS his look, thinks a moment.  He looks up at the
     WOMAN behind the counter...she's doing a crossword puzzle.

     Worm looks back to Dixon, subtle mumbles and gestures and
     few moments later, Dixon stands from the booth and exits the
     coffee shop.

     HOLD w/WORM.  He sticks a finger down his throat, makes himself
     well with tears.  He stands up OUT OF FRAME.

<b>     ANGLE, COUNTER NEAR STANLEY.
</b>     Worm sits into FRAME, near to Stanley.  Stanley glances up, they
     make a quick moment of eye contact, then look away.  BEAT. HOLD.

     He stops, hesitates, looks across the way --

     LINDA'S MERCEDES is parked.

     He hestitates a moment, looks left and right and all around
     and then he starts to walk over to the car...

     AT LINDA'S CAR.  Dixon sees that she's passed out, knocks on

     Dixon reaches down and takes her PURSE, takes the MONEY out of the
