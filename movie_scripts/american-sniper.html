       McKENNA pokes Chris and he BARKS like a dog.

<b>                              MCKENNA
</b>                 No. You're supposed to roar. Like Grrr.

       She pokes him again and Chris emits a RUMBLING ROAR. She
       giggles and hugs him so he'll save her.

<b>                              CHRIS
</b>                 I should get going...

       He kisses his daughter and tosses his son's hair.

<b>                              CHRIS
</b>                 Look after our women, Bubba.
                        (turns to Taya)
                 Love you, babe.

<b>                              TAYA
</b>                 Love you too.

       Chris kisses Taya and lingers, worshiping her. Dust motes
       drift past and he appears immortal in the bladed light.

       Then--

       He walks out the door for the last time. The house grows
       quiet. Colton plays video games. McKenna colors. The dog
       lays by the door. And Taya stands in the golden light.

        CARD(1): "On February 2, 2013, Chris Kyle was killed by
       a former Marine he was trying to help. He died as he

ACTUAL FOOTAGE: A funeral procession appears over a
distant ridge. Police escorts lead a white hearse and 300
vehicles down a highway lined with people waving flags.

The last car finally passes. An UNKNOWN CIVILIAN stands
alone in a muddy field saluting a fallen hero.
