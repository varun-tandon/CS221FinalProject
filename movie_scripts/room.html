    Darkness. The faint background hum of a refrigerator. A light
    clicks on, briefly, then snaps off again.

    Then on again, for a little longer.

    We wake groggily with JACK (five), blinking up at MA (26).
    She's standing in a worn t-shirt and underwear beside a lamp,
    switching it on and off at apparently random intervals. She
    cranes up at the recessed skylight, Room's only window.

    The irregular flashes of lamp-light reveal glimpses of this
    little world lined with cork: ten foot a side, seven foot
    high, gabled ceiling rising to ten foot.

    Clusters of Jack's and Ma's vivid drawings are pinned all
    over the walls, quivering in the draft from the vents. Done
    with five crayons (red, yellow, blue, orange, green) and
    pencil on toilet tissue, lined pages or cardboard, they show
    dogs, trees, aliens, rocket ships, figures labelled 'Jack' or
    'Ma'. Delicate mobiles (uncooked spaghetti, threads,
    plastics, foil, down from pillows, cloth scraps) dangle.

    A wardrobe with slatted louver doors. On top, toys crafted
    from garbage, a Labyrinth from toilet-roll insides.

    A dresser with a TV. A homemade pack of cards, papier mâché
    checkers and chess. A Fort constructed from vitamin and other
    bottles and cans. A single meagre African violet in a pot on
    the TV.

    A round dining table, two fold-up chairs side by side.

    A bath with a single small towel over the side.
    A toilet, with a flotilla of homemade toy boats floating in
    the tank which is oddly missing a lid.

    A sink, with a single worn toothbrush, toothpaste, dish soap,
    a broken comb, folded rags for washcloths. A small square of
    mirror tile hung up over it.

    A small kitchen cabinet. A dish rack: two each of big and
    small white plates, bowls, tumblers, knives, forks, spoons
    (one with a melted handle), a scissors, can opener, serrated
    knife, wooden spoon, spatula.

    A basic stove (with more folded rags on its handle, for pot
    holders), one frying pan and one saucepan.

    A small refrigerator (more toys on top), a tiny trash.

    A rocker.    Above, a shelf. Ten books stacked. Homemade toys.

    A reddish Persian-style rug on the floor.

    A grey steel door, no handle. On the wall, a ten-digit
    keypad with a red light like a watching eye.

    Ma looks over at Jack and sees that he's awake. She mouths
    'Sh' at him, soothing him back to sleep. Keeps signalling.

    Darkness again, as Jack's eyelids fall.

    Faint light. Jack and Ma sleep face to face in a double bed
    under a thin quilt. Pale skin, long hair, wearing t-shirts.

<b>                          JACK (V.O.)

                zoomed down from heaven through
                Skylight into Room -
                    (makes noise of descent,
                     then crash landing)
                and I was kicking you from the
                inside, boom boom, and then I shot
                out onto Rug with my eyes wide
                open, and you cutted the cord and
                said "Hello Jack."

    Jack wakes.

    A little later, Ma, at the kitchen counter, measures out two
    small bowls of cereal.

    Jack moves round Room touching things: Rug's rusty bloodstain
    from his birth; the scarred Table; chairs; faucets, etc.

    Ma puts breakfast on the table. Sits.

    Jack sits, too. Ma gives him a half vitamin pill from an
    almost empty tub. She takes a contraceptive pill from a
    generic pack. They start to eat. Ma winces.

    A little later, Ma is brushing Jack's teeth (with their
    single, frayed brush) zealously. He spits with vigor.

    A little later, Ma and Jack are looking a two small piles of
    clothes.

<b>                        MA

    She reaches for her clothes.

<b>                        JACK
</b>              Me, bear and jeans.

<b>                        MA
</b>              Good choice!

    A little later. Ma scrubs the floor with an old cloth diaper
    while Jack watches TV. Both in t-shirt and jeans (Jack's with
    worn-out knees), but shoeless.

    The salsa theme tune starts.

    Ma stands up, doing a zombie impression.

<b>                        MA
</b>              Too much TV will turn us into
              zombies ... Anyway, it's time to
              mark how tall you are.

    This makes him switch the TV off fast and run to the door.

    Ma marks his height with a tiny 5 in black pen on the cork.

    Jack ducks and uses his fingers to measure the gap. Frowns.
<b>                        JACK
</b>              I'm not very taller after four.

    He touches the space between 3 (in red) and 4 (in black).

    He swallows his disappointment.

    He makes a tiny bicep. Ma musters enthusiasm at the prospect
    of him growing up.

    all the familiar obstacles.

    A little later, playing 'Track'. The rug is draped over the
    table on the bed. They run back and forward on a worn C, both
    of them training hard, like athletes.

    Later, the furniture is back in place. Jack picks Dylan the
    Digger from his stack, which includes Pop-Up Airport, My Big
    Book of Nursery Rhymes, The Runaway Bunny, Alice in
    Wonderland. (He ignores the adult books - The Da Vinci Code,
    Twilight, The Guardian, Bittersweet Love, The Shack.)

    Ma can't hide her revulsion at Dylan the Digger again.

</b>              I can read them all but I like when
              you do.

    Ma recites animatedly. Jack turns the board pages, not
    noticing that Ma's eyes are shut as she reads from memory.

    Later, Jack blows the second of two small eggs, keeping the
    shell intact. Beating butter and sugar, Ma keeps up their
    Rhyme game.

     Later. Steam makes Room mysterious. Jack lies on Ma in the

     A little later Jack watches as Ma places blankets and a
     pillow on the floor of the wardrobe.

     She checks her watch nervously: getting close to nine.

<b>                         MA
</b>               Jack, it's late. Come on.

     Jack jumps in and snuggles down. Pictures of Dora and her
     monkey Boots are glued on the back wall; this is a tiny room
     within Room. Ma covers him up for the night.

     She begins to sing `The Big Rock Candy Mountain'.

     A little later. Dim light comes through the slats. Jack lies
     stroking the dangling clothes, the pictures glued to the
     wardrobe. He freezes at the sound of the beeps that mean the
     outside door is about to open.

     He lies absolutely still, listening for Old Nick's entrance.
     He savors the scent of fresh air, but shivers: winter.

     Boom: now the door's shut again.

     Jack goes up on his elbow to squint through the slats but
     only sees a bit of the man's down jacket as he takes it off.

<b>                         OLD NICK (O.S.)

<b>                         MA

     Now OLD NICK moves into view too. Forties, solidly built,
     blue-collar: a ordinary monster.

</b>               What's that? A birthday cake?

     He cuts himself a piece and eats it in a few bites.

     Ma starts getting undressed.

     Jack twitches at this thrilling possibility.
     Old Nick starts undressing too: like some dull marriage.

     Sounds of the adults getting into bed. The lamp clicking off.

     Then the familiar creaks of the bed. Jack doesn't know what
     they mean but is troubled. He counts them under his breath.

     In the dark of the wardrobe, Jack is still counting.

</b>               Three hundred six, seven, eight -

     A primal grunt from Old Nick. The creaking is done. Jack is
     asleep at the bottom of the wardrobe.
     Old Nick goes over to the TV and switches on sports.

<b>                         MA
</b>               Shh.

     He turns down the volume. The sound of the sports broadcast
     overlaps with the thud of the door closing. The wardrobe door
     opens admitting the faint light of the L.E.D on the keypad.

     We cut to a shot of Ma putting a sleeping Jack into the bed.
     As she starts to climb in beside we pull back and crane up.

     lapse photography of one glorious tree.

     Ma is using a needle and thread to take in Jack's new, much-
     too-big jeans. Jack finds a trodden cigarette butt under the
     corner of the rug. Old Nick must have brought it in on his
     shoe. Jack studies it.

     Jack, on the bed: he squirms, twists, bounces with intense
     boyish energy.

     Beside the bed now, he runs on the spot at maximum speed. In

     Later the same day. Ma is napping. Jack is playing on the
     floor. Counting things. Tracing the patterns of rug with his
     finger.

     What was that? He stares at the floor by the stove; glimpses
     something.

     Jack tiptoes over, but the moving thing is gone. He looks
     furtively at Ma then takes out the cake. He crumbles some and
     sets the plate on the floor. He squats and waits.

     A mouse puts its nose out, sniffs and takes a crumb.

     Something smashes into the stove: one of Ma's heavy books.

     Jack cries out in shock and distress.

<b>                         JACK

     foil from the roll. Scrunches it.

     That evening. Jack sits in Ma's lap, watching a TALK-SHOW

     supports the unraveled part.

     The third morning. Jack wakes up in the bed, where Ma always
     carries him once Old Nick has gone.

     Ma is up already, sitting at the table, staring at a shiny
     red truck and remote in a hard pack. The snake is in Eden.

     Jack can hardly believe what's in front of him. He looks at
     it for a while.

     finds the packaging difficult.

               I can do it.

     Later, Jack is playing with his new toy. Ma watches him
     uneasily. We hear a faint echo of screaming ...

     CHAPTER TITLE: UNLYING The screaming get's louder.

     Later, Ma is standing on a chair screaming and howling at the
     Skylight. Jack stands in the bath screaming into the small
     air vent above the shelf. He holds his truck up to the vent
     so it can join in.

     Then they hush and listen.

     Later, Ma, preoccupied, trims mold off cheese she slices very
     thin and lays on brown bread. Puts it in the toaster oven.

     Jack zigzags his truck around chair and table legs. Ma checks
     to see if the frozen peas are boiling yet. Jack drives the
     truck at the door: clang.

     Ma belatedly realizes the grilled cheese is smoking.

     She burns her hand slightly on the oven, wrenching it open.

     That evening. Jack, in the wardrobe, is meant to be asleep
     but he's still playing with his truck.

     The door beeps; he kneels up for a glimpse as it booms shut.

</b>               Hey. What's the smell?

     He puts down groceries, unzips his jacket.

<b>                         MA (O.S.)
</b>               Sorry, I burned some cheese.

</b>               You need to take more care.

<b>                         MA (O.S.)

     Ma is unpacking the groceries.

<b>                         OLD NICK
</b>               So did he like his truck?

     He laughs at her speechless discomfort.

     She gives the required answer.

     Pause as Ma takes in the implications of this. She proceeds
     cautiously.

     Jack, frightened, shrinks back in the wardrobe knocking into
     the back panel. Old Nick turns his attention to the wardrobe.

               heads or something?

     He roots in his jacket pockets and produces an already opened
     tube of hard candy.

</b>               Hey Jack. You like candy? Wanna

     Jack, tempted, reaches for the door...
     Desperate to distract Old Nick, Ma touches his arm.

<b>                         MA

     Old Nick chuckles at this unaccustomed seductiveness.

     Pocketing the candy, he wraps himself round her.

     They edge backwards out of view.

     The lamp snaps off.

     A little later, everything is quiet.   Moonlight.

     Jack, asleep in a crooked position, wakes with a jump. He
     sits up and rubs his neck. Finds his truck. He opens the door
     and peeks out. Where's the candy?


<b>21   INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                          21

     Stepping out, holding his truck for moral support, Jack
     stumbles into something and gasps. He picks it up: a thick
     leather belt, like a cobra.

     He takes another few steps and stubs his toe on a huge boot.

     Jack stares at Old Nick, asleep in the middle of the bed.

     Ma is sleeping too, clinging to the far side.

     Now he's come this far, Jack forgets the candy, fascinated by
     Old Nick, whom he's seeing up close for the first time.

     Jack puts his finger out, almost touching Old Nick's face.

     Old Nick's eyes open, startled.   Then he grins.

<b>                            OLD NICK

     Ma leaps up screaming and flailing at Old Nick.

<b>                         MA
</b>               Get away from him! Get away!

     Jack drops his truck and races to the wardrobe.

     He jumps in and pulls the door, banging his head.

     Jack clutches his head, curled up in the corner of the
     wardrobe, because it hurts, and to shut out Ma's screeching.

</b>               Stop that noise.

     Ma is suddenly muted. The thump of Old Nick throwing her down
     on the bed. The lamp snaps on. Jack flinches and turns his
     face away from the light.

     Sound of the door opening, then shutting with a boom. Jack
     waits to hear what Ma will do or say to him.

     The lamp clicks off again: darkness. Jack dives out of the
     wardrobe.

     Shot of ice-crystals on the skylight. Silence: no
     refrigerator hum.

     Jack wakes first, shivering, though he doesn't know why. He
     is astonished by purple bruises around Ma's throat. As if she
     feels his gaze, Ma wakes and musters a smile. Jack notices
     the white clouds of their breath in the air.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Ma, we're dragons.

     Ma sits up. Registers the chill. Getting out of bed, she
     turns on the lamp: no light. Jack is crushed to finds his
     Jeep, one wheel snapped off.

     Ma opens the refrigerator: dark inside. She's appalled.

<b>                         MA
</b>               He's cut the power.

     She glances at the keypad: its little red light is out.

     With a wild, illogical hope, she hurls herself at the door
     and claws at its edges - but it's still locked. Jack watches,
     bewildered: he's never seen her try to open it.

     Jack is at the table reading to his injured truck from ALICE.
     Both are dressed in all their clothes in an effort to keep
     warm.

<b>                         JACK

               think that very few things indeed
               were really impossible.

     Ma comes to the table and doles out half-thawed green beans.

     Jack makes himself chew a limp bean. Ma nibbles a few, with a
     show of enthusiasm. Jack looks at his three-wheeled truck.

     the truth.

</b>               There's no magic! Everything we see
               on TV - it's pictures of real stuff
               and real people in the world.

     Controlling her exasperation, Ma gets out a half slice of
     bread and adds a rationed scraping of peanut butter. She sets
     down his food and he comes to the table to eat it.

     Ma stands with her hands in her armpits to warm them. She
     stares around as if for proof. Cranes up at the skylight.

     She climbs up on a chair and lifts Jack onto her shoulders so
     he can see. His head is close to the recessed skylight. He
     looks at a brown, sodden half-rotted leaf.

<b>                          JACK
</b>               Dumbo Ma. That's not a leaf. Leaves

               instead of sideways.

     Jack suddenly struggles to get down, nearly toppling them.

     They face each other, standing with the table between them.
     Ma musters the energy to try again, telling him her own story
     this time. She picks up Jack's copy of ALICE IN WONDERLAND.

               Fine. That's fine Jack.

     Another long miserable pause. Jack, angry and upset, watches
     her for a while then sits down on the floor and takes out his
     toys from under the TV. He plays quietly.

     Ma looks up at the skylight. As she watches a gust of wind
     blow the leaf away.
     LATER - dusk

     Ma and Jack are in bed, under the duvet in their clothes,
     shuddering with cold. Jack tries the lamp. Nothing. He fixes
     the dents in the shade then lies back down. A terrible
     flatness in the air. Ma is turned away from Jack. She has
     been crying.

     Later. TV off. Jack creeps up to Ma and studies what he can
     see of her bruises, which are more purple-black today.

     He tries to read Ma's watch but the angle makes it hard.

     He plays at switching Ma on with the remote.

     Later. Jack plays chess (with their homemade papier mâché
     set) against his truck.

     Later. Kicks a shrivelled red balloon to keep it in the air.

     Later. It's turned cloudy. Jack nibbles a bagel at the table.

     He examines the truck's broken axle. Yanks on another wheel
     until it snaps off. Then the last two. He twists the doors
     off. Stuffs the truck, its parts and remote in the trash.

     Later, light fading. Jack lies beside Ma, longing to
     breastfeed. Lifts the edge of her t-shirt, but doesn't dare.

     He sits up, rests his hand on the bump of Ma's foot.

     A little later. Jack is watching wildlife while Ma cleans up
     from breakfast: baby turtles emerging from shells and heading
     down the beach.

     Tying up the trash bag, she finds the truck, and realizes

               dress-up, pretending to be people
               from hundreds of years ago.

     Jack is puzzled by that.

     He switches channels: TOM AND JERRY.

     This suddenly punctures her mood.

</b>               One night I stood behind the door
               with the lid of the toilet tank -

     Jack looks towards it, confused: what lid?

</b>               - it used to have a lid, it was the
               heaviest thing in Room. When he
               came in I tried to smash it down on
               his head. But I messed up, Jack.
               He shoved the door shut and grabbed
               me by the wrist - that's why it's
               sore now.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               We could wait till he's asleep and

     Jack clenches his teeth and starts to writhe and roll side to
     side.

     He rolls over face down, and gets his butt slightly in the
     air, bending the cylinder of the rug.

     He rolls the other way, sits up: the rug opens. He claws his
     way out, his face red and smeared. Ma is looking almost as
     distraught as him, but she grins.

     Jack is tilted head down as Old Nick taps the code. Ma starts
     to moan quietly. A swaying motion as he carries Jack outside.

     Ma's voice is cut off by the boom of the door.

     through the end of the carpet.

     A terrible pause as Old Nick contemplates the back yard. Then
     walks on. Jack is heaved face-down into the flatbed of an old
     pick-up.

     A pause - Jack senses a light going on nearby. Then the clang
     of a shovel being dropped onto the bed of truck beside the
     rug.

     Old Nick's footsteps, heading for the driver's seat. Sound of
     the truck rumbling to life.

     At last he remembers that he's meant to be wriggling out.

     He writhes, but the rug has tightened in transit.

     With an effort, Jack manages to roll over. No better.

     The engine quietens as the truck slows. Jack is not sure if
     that's his signal and anyway he's still trapped in the rug.

     The truck doesn't stop at the stop sign, only slows.

     Jack remembers his arm. He forces it above his head, wincing
     as the rug scrapes the skin off his elbow. Jack puts all his
     misery into movement, thrashing about, kicking, jack-knifing
     like a dying fish.

     The truck's engine lulls as it makes a rolling stop.

     Jack feels the rug slide a little across the flatbed, which
     gives him just enough momentum that he bends, with a deep
     grunt, and the rug starts to roll open.

     He bursts out, on hands and knees: like a birth. Elbow and
     lip bloody, face covered in hair, snot and tears.

     The world hits Jack: street lamps, wind in his face, shocking
     colors of the sunset. Trees and houses looming and then
     receding, like a rollercoaster.

     His glance falls on the shovel meant for his grave.

     Jack's eyes focus on the cab of the truck and what he
     realizes must be the back of Old Nick's head, driving.

     Old Nick slows at the third stop, and swings right. Jack is
     flung headlong, banging his leg on the left of the flatbed.
     The truck screeches to a stop, because Old Nick heard the
     noise and glimpsed Jack in his rearview mirror.

     He flings the driver's door open.

     Jack scrabbles over to the opposite side.

     Old Nick jumps down and strides around the truck.

     Jack leaps down to the tarmac, bloodying his left knee. His
     jaw smashes into his right knee. He picks a direction at
     random and tears away from the truck, stumbles, keeps going.

     A large dog on a long leash, emerges from a yard.

     DOUG(a big man in his forties) and his 2-year-old daughter
     CARRIE, both in winter outdoor clothes, follow.

     Jack runs into the man, finds himself on the ground with the
     dog snarling at him.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>               Boomer!

     He pulls the dog away by the collar.

     Old Nick catches up, and scoops Jack up with one arm.

     Pinned in the air, Jack lashes out in soundless terror. Old
     Nick strides back towards the truck with him.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>               Excuse me? Hey.

     Old Nick puts Jack down but holds his shoulders.

     Jack cringes, eyes on the ground.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>               I'm so sorry. Is your little girl

</b>
<b>                         OLD NICK
</b>               It's under control.

     Doug stares at Jack's bloody knee, elbow, lip.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>               She been in some kind of accident?

</b>               I'll take care of it.

     Jack can't speak, but pulls out the note. Old Nick snatches
     it out of his hand, scrunching it.

<b>                         DOUG
</b>               What's that you got there, honey?

     He pulls out his cellphone and dials. Old Nick picks up Jack
     again and hurries to his truck.

     Doug waits impatiently for the emergency operator.

</b>               Hey! Hey!

     Jack, lying in a heap, hears the driver's door slam.

     Then the engine starts. Jack looks around: the truck is
     barrelling towards him. Confused and dizzy, he crawls towards
     the sidewalk. The truck roars past: a getaway, not attempted
     murder.

     Jack watches the truck zoom through the next stop.

     He collapses and blinks up at the vast evening sky. After a
     beat, Doug, leaning in, interrupts the view. The dog is
     there, too.

<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)
</b>               It's OK, Honey.

     Jack curls himself up in a ball.

     A patrol car pulls up at the scene. Doug leaves the still
     curled up Jack and hurries to the car to talk to the emerging
<b>     OFFICER GRABOWSKI.
</b>
     Jack, shuddering with cold notices Carrie staring at him.

     He feels his lip, touches the blood, looks at it, tastes.
     Then sees an oval on the ground. He picks it up: a leaf.

     OFFICER PARKER, a female officer, hunkers down beside him.

<b>                         OFFICER PARKER
</b>               Hey there, I'm Officer Parker.
               What's your name?

     There's something reassuring about her and Jack forces
     himself to talk to one of these alien beings - but barely
     whispering, and he can't look her in the eye.

     She leans in to hear him better. Jack flinches away.

     Officer Grabowski comes closer now, on his walkie-talkie.

     He spreads his two hands. He still can't meet her eye but
     he's desperately trying to communicate.

</b>               Five, great. And your address?

     Jack doesn't know what this means, so ignores it. Back with a

</b>               A shed! You're doing great, Jack.
               Now, after you got in the truck -

     Jack shakes his head.

                   (mimes being flung across

     Minutes later. Outside an unlit house, with a Police van and
     a back-up, unmarked car parked facing the other way. A plain
     clothes OFFICER is knocking on the front door of the house.
     Jack watches through the car window as Officer Parker
     consults with an OLDER WHITE MALE OFFICER, also plain
     clothes. Parker and the older officer start to poke around
     the side of the house, disappearing for a moment before
     running back. Officer Parker takes what looks like a crowbar
     from the trunk of the car. She draws her weapon. Grabowski
     moves to leave the car.

     She disappears around the back of the house. Jack
     hyperventilates, thinking about Old Nick and Ma.

     We hear shouting, a crack of splitting wood. Jack starts
     clawing at the car door, can't find the handle.

</b>               Hey, hey, take it easy.

     A figure hurtles towards the car: Ma. She can't get the door
     open either because of the lock.

     Faces pressed to the glass, she and Jack almost touch. Then,
     at last the door is open and Jack is in her arms.

     the police cruiser moves through the night.

     Jack does a huge yawn, utterly exhausted now the adrenalin is
     gone.

      Still in Ma's arms, Jack half wakes to find himself carried
      through a hospital emergency room. They are being bustled
      along by Officers Parker and Grabowski, A FEMALE PLAIN
      CLOTHES DETECTIVE, a DOCTOR, a NURSE and a HOSPITAL SECURITY
      GUARD. A woman in her 50s, is beside them, her arm around MA.
      This is NANCY, Ma's mother. It's like a strange dream to
      Jack. Through the group around him he can make out other
      figures waiting in chairs. He can hear a drunk shouting,
      phones ringing.

      Ma shushes him, stroking his hair. He drifts back to sleep.

      Next morning. A bright hospital room. Jack and Ma share the
      fancy hospital bed. A cot bed, unused, has been set up to one
      side. Jack is awake but content to lie close to Ma for a
      while - studying the dials and switches on the wall above his
      head. He looks at Ma, asleep, bruises fading to yellow-green.
      He sits up and pulls back the sheet. He's wearing only a pair
      of underpants from Room which look particularly wretched in
      this new antiseptic environment. He touches the part of the
      mattress he's being lying on. It's damp. He examines a
      bandage on his knee. He gets up. On a side table, he sees a
      plate with the remains of some toast on it and a half drunk
      cup of tea. He sniffs at the food. There are two surgical
      masks there, also. He walks slowly to the opposite wall, his
      little figure silhouetted against the translucent blinds. He
      stops in front of the one window which has its blind drawn.
      The hospital suite is high up and the view is spectacular.

     From the back we study Jack's small figure and beyond it the
     vast world below.

     Coming around on Jack's face we see that he is trying to make
     sense of what he's seeing. It takes him a moment to realize
     what he's looking at and how high above ground he is. His
     breathing quickens and he turns and scurries back to bed.

     He shakes his mom.

<b>                           JACK

     She begins to wake.

               A bedroom in a hospital.

     Jack thinks about this.

</b>               Are we sick for real or pretend?

      it up.

</b>                Yes, just now. OK ... if that's OK,

      Ma hangs up as Jack starts tugging the sheets off the bed.
      She stops him.

      Ma steps out of bed. She's wearing a robe. It says `Tyler
      Forest Hospital'

      She picks up a robe from beside the bed, puts him in it -
      it's way too big, then she begins to take off his damp
      underpants.

     We hear voices arguing outside the door. One voice cuts
     through.

<b>                         VOICE (O.C.)
</b>               Oh for God's sake ...

               It sounds like you have more
               important things to do right now.

     The door opens and Nancy enters (we met her briefly in the
     emergency room) carrying an overnight bag. She is followed by
     a man in his sixties, rumpled from travel. This is ROBERT,
     Ma's father.

     from the back of the room.

     Jack, forgotten, is frightened by what he sees. He curls up.
     Eventually, Ma notices him.

<b>                         MA
</b>               Jack, Jack it's OK. This is your

     Jack hides his face.

<b>                         NANCY (CONT'D)
</b>               That's OK. Thanks for saving my
               little girl, Jack.

     Robert tries to smile but he is very uneasy around Jack.
     Nancy lifts the small bag she brought.

<b>                         NANCY (CONT'D)

<b>48   EXT. HOSPITAL - UPPER STOREY TERRACE - DAY                 48
</b>
     Hospital roof garden. Jack sticks close to Ma. She is dressed
     in track-suit bottoms and her old warm winter coat. Jack has
     pajamas under his robe and a warm coat which doesn't quite
     fit. Ma has a pair of her old boots on, Jack has trainers.
     They wear tinted glasses against the brightness of the day.
     Jack is a strange sight, the part of his face not covered by
     his mask (the others are unmasked) or woollen hat is smeared
     in heavy sun screen. They sit with Robert and Nancy. Nancy
     smokes a slim cigarette. Jack watches her cigarette for a
     while, then his attention is snagged by a nurse pushing an
     old woman in a wheelchair. He is also fascinated by the sky
     reflected in the mirrored glass of the building.

     Ma runs her hand along her coat.

     Jack is finding his shoes - the first he's ever worn -
     irritating. He starts to take them off.

     They hug again. Letting go at last they smile at each other
     for a long moment. We feel a history of great closeness
     between them. Ma wipes away her tears.

               hundreds of cars and birds and

               talking all at the same time. The
               world's like all TV planets on at
               the same time so I don't know which
               what to look and listen. Doors and
               doors and behind all the door
               there's another inside and another
               outside and things happen-happen-
               happening, it never stops.
               Plus the world's always changing
               brightness and hotness and there's
               invisible germs floating
               everywhere. When I was small I only
               knew small things but now I'm five

     They turn onto a residential street of low houses and well-
     groomed lawns.

     It's all familiar to Ma yet utterly strange: a crowd of media
     (national and international) is set up across the road from
     her house behind temporary barricades. There are neighbors
     and well-wishers carrying helium balloons, flowers, toys, and
     signs. POLICE keep order.

     Ma tidies her hair.

     Nancy, Robert and a LAWYER emerge from the first car. Nancy
     manages an apologetic smile and half-wave to the neighbors
     who are watching from their own yards.

     RESIDENT AGENT leans in the driver's window to address Ma.

     They climb out, heads down, shielded by FBI agents. Jack
     stumbles, almost falls. Now they're outside they can hear a
     news helicopter overhead: it sounds like a war zone. Nancy
     joins them, taking Jack's hand, and they rush for the front

     doctor's waiting room or a stranger's house trying to make a
     good impression. All so unreal.

     Reaching the top of the stairs, they walk the quiet, carpeted
     hallway. Jack takes it all in.

     Ma and Jack enter Ma's room. They absorb the decor of Ma's
     adolescence - preserved by her mother.

</b>               This is your Mom's room, Jack.

     Jack looks around. He pulls a strand of his long hair out of
     his eyes.

</b>               Hey, maybe tomorrow we can cut that

     Jack shakes his head. Whispers to Ma.

     Jack walks over to the bed and sits down. We are with him as
     he takes in the band posters, track trophies, pictures -
     including pictures of his Mom as a young, happy girl. In the
     background Nancy and Ma watch him.

</b>               I'll let you rest. We'll be

     Before she leaves, Nancy talks quietly, insistently to Ma, we
     only catch fragments of what she's saying.

     Conventional things, promising she is there, that there's
     nothing Ma can't say to her, how much she loves her. Ma is
     quiet, a little shell-shocked. Nancy leaves.

     Struck by the sight of her music keyboard, Ma tries it: dead.
     She kneels down, finds the plug and puts it in the outlet.

<b>                         MA
</b>               You didn't know I could play piano.
               Guess this tune...

     But after a few notes of 'Home on the Range'/'Big Rock Candy
     Mountain' she stumbles. Tries again, and messes it up.
     Stretches her stiff hand. Then she sits on the bed, suddenly
     limp. Checks her watch. It's gone; an old habit. Both Ma and
     Jack are subdued.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               How long do we have to stay here?

     She takes out her bag of meds.

               We live here now.

     She swallows her antibiotics and painkillers without water.
     She lies down. We stay on Jack's face as he continues to take
     in his surroundings and digest what Ma has said. After a
     little while he lies beside her and lifts her shirt so he can
     snuggle up and breastfeed.

     We repeat a sequence of shots from life before their escape
     ending in a mother &amp; child portrait. In the little bedroom,
     they could be in Room.

     Ma, with Jack pressed close to her, sits at the dining table
     with Nancy, Robert and Leo. Desert. Jack is eating his first
     bowl of ice-cream. He takes a big mouthful and holds his hand
     to his head. He tugs at Ma and she leans down so he can
     whisper to her.

     Small talk as food is passed around. Ma puts her fork down,
     she is beginning to get upset. Nancy watches her, puts a hand
     on hers. After a little while Ma calms.

     They eat quietly, the adults aware of the complexity and
     strangeness of the situation. Jack, oblivious, chomps away at
     his ice-cream. Robert watches him.

     Jack lies awake beside his sleeping mom.

     He hears footsteps. The door cracks open and a convoluted
     shadow appears, rimmed in light. The door opens wider and the
     shadow resolves into Robert, watching his daughter and
     grandson sleep. Jack burrows into his pillow pretending to
     sleep. The door closes and soon he sleeps.

      Ma and Nancy sit with coffees. Jack has some cereal. The

      Jack shakes his head.

      A few minutes later: Nancy is cleaning up in the kitchen as
      Ma breastfeeds Jack. She looks out on the bare winter back
      yard.

      Through a chink in net curtains of a car pulling up outside
      Nancy and Leo's house. The Lawyer gets out. We see that the
      press has thinned out substantially. There are a few curious
      MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC with nothing better to do, a UNIFORMED
      POLICE OFFICER and a POLICE CAR.

      opens the door.

     The LAWYER and Nancy watch Ma filling out some forms. She is
     subdued. Jack has some blank paper in front of him. He is
     staring at a large open box of Crayola pencils; every shade
     of every color. He carefully selects 5 pencils - the 5 colors
     he's used to from Room - and begins to draw.

     Jack occasionally glances at Leo, drawn by his natural
     warmth.

      the sitting room. From where he sits he can see the open door
      to his and Ma's bedroom. It's dark inside. Eventually, Leo
      walks into view with a male DETECTIVE and a female VICTIM

     He lets them out, closes the door behind them, then peeps
     through the closed curtains. As he turns away, he spots Jack,
     gives him a salute and then busies himself in ways calculated
     to raise the interest of a 5-year-old. Tidying up, he picks
     up a ball from the floor, spins it on his finger, bounces it.
     Wanders off out of view, whistling, muttering about how
     particularly bouncy this ball is, etc.

     Jack starts down the stairs. He goes down on his backside not
     yet confident enough to do it standing.

     hat and glasses but no sun-cream.

     The back yard is a simple rectangle of grass bounded by
     barkdust and shrubbery with a few small trees. But to Jack it
     is a new cosmos. He wanders tentatively into the open space.
     Jack kneels to investigate the dirt and grass. He smells
     deeply.


     A little later, Leo and Jack throw the ball between them.
     Jack's shoes are irritating him.

</b>               I hate shoes.

<b>                         LEO
</b>               I hear what you're saying, but ...

     Leo drops the ball and kicks it to Jack who manages to kick
     it back.

<b>                         LEO (CONT'D)
</b>               They've got their uses. Am I right?

     Jack nods. They play awhile, getting farther apart.

     She picks up her old laptop from the floor by the bed. She
     has been looking through her friends pages on Facebook. She
     clicks on a couple of pages showing the same girls as they
     are now, then loses interest, closes the laptop.

               while. Okey dokey?

     They sit. She stands and paces the room, gnawing her lips,
     wincing, trying and failing to keep her despair out of view.

     The car drifts around, eventually finds a spot. Ma, Jack and
     Laura emerge. Jack is facing away from the mall. He is held
     by the big open view of the car park and road network beyond.

     They walk through the whooshing doors of the mall and step
     onto the ascending escalator. In the atrium, mobiles,
     banners, skylights. Teenagers, families, everyone scanning
     the myriad goods on display. At the top of the escalator Jack
     sees a huge array of fruit and vegetables outside a
     supermarket.

     Further along, they pass a bookstore. Jack spots a display of
     new Dylan the Digger books. He grabs one.

     and mirrors.

     They tear through the racks. Techno music throbs. The

      Later. Hushed. Jack eating at the table. Leo reads the
      sports pages nearby, a silent companion.

      Jack can hear Ma, in the lounge, talking low to Nancy. He
      recognizes low sobs: Ma is crying.

      Jack stops eating halfway through a mouthful, can't swallow.

      he touches the mark her body's left. No Ma in the room.

      Jack walks on tiptoe down the landing.

      The last door is the bathroom, and there's a crack of light.

      Jack taps very quietly on the door, remembering the rule.

<b>                             JACK
</b>                Ma?

      He goes to the top of the stairs and considers descending.

      Then he creeps back to the bathroom, whispers a bit louder.

      He tries the handle, but the door opens only a few inches.
      Frightened he starts to bang on the door.

                Ma! Ma!

      An adult torso, Leo's, comes into the frame, driving with
      full force against the door which gives a little. Jack puts
      his face to the gap and sees Ma's hair spread out on the
      floor.

      A little later. Jack gets glimpses of chaos: on the bathroom
      floor, TWO PARAMEDICS working on Ma (who responds just enough
      that we know she's not dead), Nancy in the bathroom doorway,
      Leo trying to calm her.

      But no sound.   It's as if Jack has been deafened by an
      explosion.

      Later: as Ma is carried out in the background, Jack sits on
      the floor. We push in on him; he is hypnotized by the
      flashing ambulance lights on the wall.

                the time has to be spread extra
                thin over all the places like
                butter, so all the persons say
                hurry up, let's get going, pick up
                the pace, finish up now. Ma was in
                a hurry to go boing up to heaven
                but she forgot me, Dumbo Ma, so the
                aliens threw her back down
                craaaaaaaash and broke her.

      Next morning. Jack in a ball on the bed. He opens his fist;
      Bad Tooth, all he has of Ma.

      In the background we hear the phone ringing.

      Jack is drawing a multicolored picture.

      He uses all the colors of the crayon box.

      The picture of a house grows in colors and dimensions. The
      door is green. The windows orange. The roof red.

      Jack plays with the Neighbor Boy and Seamus in the garden. He
      hears a tap tap tap and looks round. Ma is watching him
      through the glass back door. He runs to her as she opens the
      door. They greet each other with nervous joy, without words.

      She strokes his short hair then reaches into her bag and
      takes out his ponytail.

      A police car pulls up outside Old Nick's. Jack, Ma and
      Officer Parker get out. They stare at the house, still
      surrounded by crime-scene tape.

      The car port is now sealed off and the only way out back it
      through the house. Jack follows Ma and Officer Parker inside.
      It's tidy (except for a desk ransacked by police),
      anonymously banal: a leather suite, a cross-trainer, a flat-
      screen TV.

      They step out into the back yard. Jack's gaze moves to the
      grey shed. A double-take: it's Room.

      With an enormous bulldozer beside it.

      They step in. Drawings stripped off the walls, furniture
      shifted: the magic's gone. Jack stares and sniffs the air.

      Jack retraces their track marks around the bed. He draws a J
      in the fingerprint powder on the table.

      Their Plant is all shrivelled. Jack strokes it.

      Under the bed, he finds Eggsnake; touches the needle tongue.

      He comes back to the doorway, where Ma stands frozen. He
      measures his height with his hand: an inch over the 5.

      He hears bird song from the yard; patter of rain.
<b>                          JACK

      Jack looks around at the detritus of his childhood. Then he
      walks to the wall behind the bed and pats it.

      onto the table.
