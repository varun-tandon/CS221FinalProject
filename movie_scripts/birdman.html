     We hear a clock ticking.

</b>     Close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug, the
     center of what seems to be a makeshift "meditation" space.

     We slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson (55).
     He is in the proper `Lotus' position, dressed only in tight
     white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply. And if all
     this seems a little odd, it becomes all the more so when you
     notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor.
     His breath is calm and measured... in and out... in and out.

                   (Beat.)
               This place is a fucking dump.

     We begin to slowly move toward Riggan's back while his measure
     breathing continues. We see a clock on the wall, ticking.

<b>                         MAN (V.O.)
</b>               Smells like balls.

     A slight twitch in Riggan's neck.

<b>                         MAN (V.O.)
</b>               We don't belong in this shithole.

     A Skype call shatters the silence. Close on his back, we follow
     Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call.
     On the computer screen appears Sam (21), in a pair of Levi's
     and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. She has simple and striking good
     looks, with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes. She
     stands in a Korean Deli among the flowers, talking to Riggan
     through her iPhone.

     The Korean Store owner (50) stands in the background screaming
     at her the whole time.

              What kind of flowers did you say you
              wanted?

<b>                        RIGGAN
</b>              Alchemillas. Or something soothing that
              smells nice. Listen I can't--
<b>                        SAM
</b>              It all smells like fucking Kimchi!

<b>                        RIGGAN
</b>              Then whatever looks nice. Anything but
              roses. No roses.

<b>                        KOREAN

</b>                  (Close into the screen.)
              I hate this job.

    And the Skype call is over. Riggan closes the laptop and leans
    forward trying to regain his calm. His reflection appears in
    the mirror, and for the first time we see his face. He has a
    dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant. There is a
    piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase "A
    thing is a thing, not what it is said of that thing."

<b>                        RIGGAN
</b>              Shit...
    Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. He
    hurries out...

<b>2   INT. HALLWAYS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            2
</b>
    ...through the narrow corridors of the theater. There is a lot
    of activity as various workers and stage hands appear and
    disappear carrying equipment and scenery. As Riggan descends the
    stairs, a Stage Hand· passes by in the opposite direction.

</b>                  (Already passed.)
              Okay.

    Riggan continues on until he arrives backstage. He runs into
    Jake (42) his producer and friend.

<b>                        JAKE
</b>              How's it going, buddy.

<b>                        RIGGAN
</b>              Great. It'd be even better if I
              could get Ralph to stop acting like
              he's in an educational video for
              syphilis...
    The camera moves off of them and onto...

<b>3   INT. STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                              3
</b>    ...the stage. Suddenly we are in the midst of an Americana style
    kitchen.

    Around the kitchen table sit Lesley (35), plain and no nonsense,
    her simple hairstyle and makeup can't hide how attractive she
    is. Laura (35), dark, exotic, the kind of woman who makes every
    person she meets feel like she's seducing them. And Ralph (40),
    slightly handsome, slightly balding, slightly invisible.

    A half empty bottle of gin on the table, they drink from
    highball glasses as they chat...

<b>                        LESLEY
</b>              He loved me.

<b>                        RALPH
</b>              Yeah. He loved her so much he tried
              to kill her.

<b>                        LAURA
</b>              He tried to kill you?

<b>                        LESLEY
</b>              No. (A beat.) Okay, well, he did
              beat me up one night. He dragged me
              around the living room by my
              ankles, yelling "I love you, I love

</b><b>                    LESLEY (CONT'D)
</b>          you, bitch." What do you do with a
          love like that?

<b>                    RALPH
</b>          How is that-- That is not love and you know
          it. Why do you insist on calling it--

<b>                    LESLEY
</b>          You can say what you want, but I know what
          it was.
<b>                    RALPH
</b>          What about you, Nick? Does that sound like
          love to you?

Riggan arrives at the table and sits.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          Sorry I'm late.
              (Beat. In character.)
          I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't
          know the man. I've only heard his name
          mentioned in passing. You'd have to
          know the particulars. But I think what
          you're saying is that love is absolute.

<b>                    RALPH
</b>          Yeah. The kind of love I'm talking about
          is... The kind of love I'm talking about,
          you don't try and kill people.

<b>                    LESLEY
</b>              (Sadly.)
          It was love, Mel. To Eddie, it was. I don't
          care what anybody says. He was ready to die
          for it.

<b>                    RALPH
</b>          Ask her what he did after she left him.

<b>                    LESLEY
</b>          He shot himself in the mouth. But he
          screwed that up, too. Poor Ed.

<b>                    RALPH
</b>          Poor Ed, my ass. The guy was dangerous.

<b>                     LAURA
</b>          How'd he screw it up if he shot himself in
          the mouth?

<b>                    RALPH

          like fugitives those days. I never knew--

</b>              (Breaking character to direct.
               Exasperated.)
          Okay. Fugitives are on the run, Ralph. How
          many times do I have to-- Fugitives are
          scared. Give me more of that.

Ralph nods. He takes a breath and dives in once again...

<b>                    RALPH
</b>              (The same but louder.)
          We lived like fugitives those days...

Extremely frustrated, Riggan stares out into the auditorium.
From his POV we see Jake who is now sitting in the third row.
His head buried in his hands, tortured by Ralph's performance.
Riggan turns back to Ralph.

<b>                    RALPH (CONT'D)
</b>          ...I never knew if he was going to come out
          of the bushes or from behind a car and just
          start shooting.

Riggan watches Ralph act and sees his whole production headed
down the drain. Ralph is just that bad.

<b>                    RALPH (CONT'D)
</b>          The man was crazy. He was capable of
          anything.

The actors all wait for a cue from Riggan, who is now staring
up into the lights above the stage. Laura finally picks up
Riggan's cue.

<b>                    LAURA
</b>          Christ. What a nightmare...

<b>                    RALPH
</b>          He used to call me at the hospital and
          say...
              (Over the top.)
          "Son of a bitch. Your days are numbered."

Silence. Ralph looks over to Riggan.

<b>                    RALPH (CONT'D)
</b>          Too much? Little bit? I just wanted to give
          you a range, so you could--

And with that a light comes barreling down from it's perch and
crashes into Ralph's head, making him hit the floor like a rag
doll. Silence.

<b>                       LAURA
</b>          Holy shit.

</b>
    Lesley and Annie (35), the Stage Manager, run over to Ralph
    who is out cold. Not knowing what to do, they stare at him.

<b>                        LESLEY
</b>              Is he breathing?

    Jake runs toward the stage.

<b>                        JAKE
</b>              Someone call 911!
    Riggan slowly backs away from the chaos.

<b>                        LAURA
</b>              Is that blood coming out of his
              ear?

    Riggan heads off the stage, and Jake chases after him. We

Riggan slams the door shut on Jake. A beat. On a television, a
segment of E! News. A busty blond, with an exaggerated smile,
hosts.

Riggan stares into the mirror, in the reflection he catches
sight of a poster from a movie called "Birdman 3". The
superhero, Birdman (a younger Riggan in a bird costume), wings
widely spread, stares directly back at him. A hand written
note on the top of the poster reads: "Thomson, break a wing!
From the boys at Local 1." Riggan tries to calm himself with a
mantra...

Laura opens the door again.

</b>               Fun? You know what would be fun? Getting

               ourselves. That would be fun.

     Riggan looks at himself in the mirror and begins to pull at
     his hair. As it comes off his head, we discover it was a wig.
     He turns away from the mirror, trying desperately to stay
     calm. Something catches his eye: a vase of roses on the end
     of the table. A card in them says, "They didn't have the
     whatever you wanted - Sam". Enraged, Riggan focuses on the
     vase. It begins to shift. Then, with a surge of anger,
     without ever touching it, he sends it crashing against the
     wall on the other side of the room.

     The camera pans over the roses scattered across the floor. It
     hovers over the carpet and around the perimeter of the room,
     until it finally settles on Riggan, now dressed in a casual
     blazer.

     It is later the same day. He is sitting on the sofa and on three
     chairs in front of him are three journalists:

     Gabriel, a geeky theatre journalist, wearing thick glasses and
     a thin tie. Clara, a reporter from an entertainment blog. And
     Han, a polite, obese Japanese journalist, who sits next to his
     translator, another Japanese guy.

<b>                         GABRIEL
</b>               Why does somebody go from playing the lead
               in a comic book franchise to adapting
               Raymond Carver for the stage?

     Riggan tries to remain calm.

<b>                         GABRIEL (CONT'D)
</b>               I mean, as you're probably aware, Barthes
               said, "The cultural work done in the past
               by gods and epic sagas is now done by
               laundry detergent commercials and comic

<b>                    LESLEY
</b>          I can call him and find out.

Riggan gives Jake a look.

<b>                    JAKE
</b>          I'll call his agent.

Jake charges out of the room. The camera follows him into...

    ...the hallway and as Jake makes a left turn, Annie enters from
    the right.

</b>              Annie, turn the work lights on and get me a

    Jake disappears down the hall and we follow Annie through the
    theater and onto...

<b>7   INT. STAGE - THEATER - EVENING                              7
</b>    ...the stage, where she turns some of the stage work lights on.
    We pan along the stage until we find Riggan, wearing the same
    clothes as before, scanning the empty auditorium.

<b>                        MIKE (O.S.)
</b>              Intimidating. Isn't it?

    Riggan sees Mike Shiner (39) coming down the aisle, slovenly
    dressed with mussed hair and intense eyes.

<b>                        MIKE (CONT'D)
</b>              Do you have any idea who walked these
              boards before you?
                  (Beat.)
              Geraldine Page, Marlon Brando,
              Helen Hayes, Jason Robards... And
              now you. Riggan Thomson.

    Riggan, trying to hide the intimidation.

A sly smile from Mike. He leaps onto the stage.

<b>                    MIKE
</b>          Why don't we do a bit of it?

</b>          Yeah, but you can go on with the script
          until you feel comfortable--

<b>                    MIKE
</b>          Let's just do some of it.

Riggan tries to hide his excitement. He grabs the script from a
nearby table and walks it over to Mike.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          Take a look at page twenty--

<b>                    MIKE
</b>          Yeah. I don't need that.

</b>          What?

<b>                    MIKE
</b>          I don't need the script. Just give me a
          cue.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          What are you talking about?

<b>                    MIKE
</b>          Feed me a line.

</b>
<b>                    MIKE
</b>          Feed. Me. A line.

Riggan drops the script and begins the scene.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          "I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't
          know the man. I've only heard his name
          mentioned in passing. I wouldn't know.
          You'd have to know the particulars. But
          I think what you're saying is that love
          is absolute."

Mike stares at Riggan, hyper-focused.

<b>                    MIKE
</b>              (Ruminating.)
          Am I saying that love is absolute?

<b>          "
</b>              (An intense pause.)
          Well, you don't try to kill people.

Riggan is transfixed, and almost immediately intimidated.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          How do you know the lines?

<b>                    MIKE
</b>          I have a thing, a whatever, a gift.

</b>          No, go ahead.

<b>                    MIKE
</b>          Follow me. He says, "I'm the wrong
          person to ask." What's his intention?
          Is he fed up with the topic?
          Deflecting? Guilt about his wife maybe?
          Then four sentences all say the same
          thing... "I didn't even know the man."

Riggan calls over to the wings.

Mike turns to see Sam, who has been there for a bit.

    Moving by her, into a dressing room.

Mike takes off his shirt and hands it to Sam. She doesn't budge,
and it hits the floor. He begins to unbutton his pants...

Larry begins to help Mike into some pants which, given the
situation, is very awkward.

naked Mike. She doesn't notice Sam who is partially hidden by a

They both look back at Mike.

     Lesley moves toward Mike. He cups her face in his hands
     tenderly. They are face to face.

     She puts her head on Riggan's chest. We see his mind racing.
     Laura is moved, and confused.

<b>                         LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>               Are you excited?

     Laura moves slightly away from him and suddenly slaps him across
     the face. Riggan looks at her, confused.

     She kisses him intensely on the lips and briefly places his
     hand on her belly, then moves it up to her breasts. After a
     moment, she backs away.

</b>               First preview tomorrow. Here we go!

     Laura turns and walks away. Riggan continues down the
     corridor. He passes by a Security Guard· in front of a small
     TV. The camera becomes Riggan's POV and advances until...

     ...we go through the stage door. We scan the backstage area to
     see the stagehands ready to do their jobs. We can feel the
     electricity of a first preview.

     On stage part of the kitchen set from before is visible. Annie
     stands at her podium, calling the cues for the show.

<b>                       RIGGAN (O.S.)
</b>          Okay.

Riggan walks on screen wearing his costume, carrying a bucket of
ice and a bottle of gin. He goes to the opposite side of the
stage and takes his place in the wings. He peeks out at the
audience who seem to be watching with interest.

Then we pan to the stage to find Mike, Lesley and Laura
performing the scene we saw at the beginning, around the table.
Mike looks comfortable, sipping at his drink. A half empty
bottle of gin on the table.

<b>                    MIKE
</b>          The maniac shot himself right in front of
          us. I rode with him in the ambulance to the
          hospital.

<b>                    LESLEY
</b>          I'll never get that image out of my head.
          Right before he did it, his eyes-- they
          were so sad... lonely.

<b>                    LAURA
</b>          Did you have to treat him?

<b>                    MIKE
</b>          I didn't have to. But I did.
              (Pouring another drink.)
          He was in bad shape. His head swelled
          up to like twice the size of a normal
          head. I'd never seen anything like
          it. And I swear to God, I hope I
          never do again.

Riggan stands near Annie.
<b>                       RIGGAN
</b>          He's good.

<b>                    ANNIE
</b>          He's incredible. I think he's
          drinking real gin.

Riggan looks out at Mike, who is refilling his glass.

     A stagehand gives Riggan a bottle. Riggan watches and waits
     for his cue.

</b>     ...where Mike goes to refill his glass with the last of the
     real gin. Riggan snatches the bottle out of his hands and
     gulps the rest, straight from the bottle.

          Will you do me a favor and shut up

          Like I was saying... There's this
          old couple, had a car wreck out on
          the interstate. Some drunk kid
          plowed his dad's pick up into their
          camper.

We begin to hear the underscoring of violins.

</b>          Fucking teenager. By the time I got
          to the hospital, the kid was dead.
          He was off in a corner laid out on
          a gurney. We took the old couple up
          to the O.R.. They were a mess. We
          worked like hell on them for most
          of the night...

Over the speech, Mike reaches for the new bottle that Riggan
placed on stage. He refills his glass.

<b>                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
</b>          When we were done, we wrapped them in full
          body casts. The husband was depressed.
          Even when I told him his wife was gonna
          pull through, he was still depressed. So,
          I got up to his mouth hole and asked him,
          and he told me it was because he couldn't
          see her through the eye holes. Can you
          imagine? I'm telling you, the man's heart
          was breaking because he couldn't turn his
          goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.

Riggan is doing a good job. Lesley and Laura are genuinely
moved. Mike notices. He sips his drink.

<b>                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)

He hurls the glass against the wall. Some laughter from the

The audience is now hysterical. Dozens of cell phones
pointing at the stage. Mike walks toward the apron, facing
the audience.

Jake storms away. Riggan heads toward his dressing room. Out
of nowhere, Mike barrels into him, pinning him against a wall.

disappears into his dressing room. Riggan begins walking
again. We follow him into...

     corner, staring at Riggan. She is elegant and simply beautiful.

take out the wig.

          remember why we broke up.
Silence. Then, as if he hasn't heard what she said.

<b>                    RIGGAN

          Clooney was sitting two seats in front of
          me. With those cuff links, and that...
          chin. We ended up flying through this
          really bad storm. The plane started to
          rattle and shake, and everyone on board
          was crying... and praying. And I just sat
          there-- Sat there thinking that when Sam
          opened that paper it was going to be
          Clooney's face on the front page. Not
          mine. (A beat.) Did you know that Farrah
          Fawcett died on the same day as Michael

door.

Riggan is smacked by that memory. His eyes on the floor.

<b>                    SYLVIA (CONT'D)

     Riggan cannot deal with this right now. He continues walking

          home to your studio pals and jump right
          back into that cultural genocide you
          guys are perpetrating. "There's a
          douchbag born every minute". That was
          P.T. Barnum's premise when he got rich
          inventing the circus. And you and your
          pals know nothing's changed, and
          whatever toxic shit you make people are
          still gonna pay to see it. But, after
          you're gone, I'll still be here. I'll
          still be making my living on the stage.
          Baring my soul. Wrestling with emotions,
          complex emotions.

<b>                     RIGGAN

          emotions"?

<b>                    MIKE
</b>          Tonight was about making it alive. About
          making it bleed. This isn't the Warner
          Brothers lot, Riggan. This is the city, and
          this is how we do things.

Mike turns and opens the front door of The Rum House.

him into...

     Mike points to an Older Woman sitting at the bar. She sips a
     martini and scribbles in a notebook with a sour expression.

<b>                         MIKE (CONT'D)

          twist over a preview, alright? And don't tell
          me how to do my job. Cause, this is my town.
          And, to be honest, nobody gives a shit about

<b>                    LADY (O.S.)

Two fat tourists in "Mamma Mia" t-shirts, with a seven year old
kid, approach the table.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          Of course. It's no trouble at all.

The Lady shoves her camera into Mike's hands.

<b>                    LADY
</b>              (To Mike.)
          Would you mind?

Mike gets up with a blank expression and takes the camera.
The Lady pushes the kid into the booth next to Riggan.

She yanks the kid closer and they squeeze up against Riggan.
Mike takes the photo and holds the camera to the lady.

          And handsome!

She kisses Riggan hard on the mouth. Then gets up, giddy, and
takes her son by the hand. As the couple leaves, husband shoves
a five dollar bill into Mike's hands.

<b>                    HUSBAND
</b>          We really appreciate it.
An agitated Mike takes a sip of whiskey.

</b>          Are we good here? Cause I'm gonna go.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          See you tomorrow.

Mike places the dollar under one of the shot glasses and begins
to walk away, but then stops and turns curiously.

<b>                    MIKE
</b>          Why Raymond Carver? You never told me.

Riggan looks at Mike for a second, than reaches for his wallet
and produces an old cocktail napkin with some writing on it. He
slides it to Mike.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          A long time ago, I did a play back in
          high school in Michigan. He was in the
          audience. He sent this backstage after.

<b>                    MIKE
</b>          "Thank you for an honest performance. Ray
          Carver." What is this?

Riggan looks vulnerable. He is trying to make Mike understand
the importance of the napkin, to build a bridge between them.
<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          And that's when I knew I was going to
          be an actor.

Mike can't stop himself from smiling.

</b>          Why is that funny?

<b>                    MIKE

</b>                He was drunk.

      to Tabitha Dickinson, the Critic.

<b>                          TABITHA

                Good luck with that.

      Mike looks directly into her eyes.

<b>                          MIKE
</b>                "A man becomes a critic when he can not be an
                artist, in the same way that a man becomes an
                informer when he cannot be a soldier."
                Flaubert, right?

      He flashes his own devilish smile. She stares back. If she
      weren't so much older than him, you'd swear there was sexual
      electricity between them.

<b>                          TABITHA

</b>                Yeah. And at 8 o'clock tomorrow, he's gonna
                get on stage and risk everything. What're

     Mike smiles and waves over to an obviously nervous Riggan. He
     goes toward the exit, but we stay with Tabitha, scribbling on
     her notebook. Suddenly she raises her eyes and, with a dark
     expression, looks at Riggan who is passing by.

     We follow Riggan toward the exit. Through the window we see him
     leave the restaurant. Then we pan to a wooden wall, and this
     wall takes us to...

               people began to forget who was inside the
               bird costume. You're doing a play based on
               a book that was written 60 years ago, for
               a thousand rich, old white people whose
               only real concern is gonna be where they
               go to have their cake and coffee when it's
               over. Nobody gives a shit but you. And
               let's face it, Dad, it's not for the sake
               of art. It's because you just want to feel
               relevant again. Well, there's a whole
               world out there where people fight to be
               relevant every day. And you act like it
               doesn't even exist! Things are happening
               in a place that you willfully ignore, a
               place that has already forgotten you. I
               mean who are you? You hate bloggers. You
               make fun of twitter. You don't even have a
               Facebook page. You're the one who doesn't
               exist. You're doing this because you're
               scared to death, like the rest of us, that
               you don't matter. And you know what?
               You're right. You don't. It's not

     Silence. Riggan seems devastated, and Sam can see that.

     She looks at him sympathetically, but not knowing what to
     say... exits.

     After a moment Riggan gets up and heads for the trash can. He
     digs out the roach, grabs some matches and lights it. Music
     begins to sound. He inhales deeply and holds the smoke for a
     few seconds and finally exhales. He coughs, tosses away the
     joint and heads out of the kitchen. We follow him...

      ...backstage. We are in the middle of the second preview. The
      music continues, it belongs to the play.

      Laura is by herself on stage performing the end of a scene. She
      stands in the middle of a surrealistic forest set, at dusk.
      There is fog, and trees. A strong, artificial wind blows
      through Laura's hair. Desolate music.

<b>                          LAURA
</b>                    (To the audience as soliloquy.)
                In the days before Nick's depression really
                started to eat away at him, he had no idea
                I was pregnant. And I never intended on
                telling him. I guess we make choices in
                life, and we choose to live with them. Or
                not. I didn't want that baby...

      Three dancers on stage pass by in front of Laura. We follow
      the dancers backstage where we find Mike and Lesley wearing
      pajamas.
<b>                          LAURA (O.S.) (CONT'D)

                because I didn't love the-- The idea of
                it. But because I just wasn't ready to
                love myself. There's a certain distance to
                it all now. A wistful distance.
                Underscored by a gentle breeze and the
                sound of the birds... laughing at the
                whimsy of it all.

      A stage hand helps Mike and Lesley into a double bed. The
      camera slips under the covers with them and stays there.

     Mike, lost in his libido, has begun to have sex with Lesley.
     The camera comes out from under the covers and pans to Riggan
     who stumbles into what is now the Motel Room set. He wears a
     mustache and a long wig, that makes him look like a wild man.
     He holds a gun in his right hand. A neon "Motel" sign is
     illuminated. A clever effect of falling rain is visible behind
     the set, accompanied by the appropriate sound effect. Riggan
     is wet because of the "rain".

     Lesley uses Riggan's entrance to escape from Mike.

Mike hops out of bed, unaware of the very noticeable erection
protruding underneath his pajama bottoms.

Some laughter from the audience.

</b>          What are you doing here?
Lesley doesn't understand the audience response, until she
notices the erection herself.

          Fuck you. Shut up. Fuck you.

He shoves Mike violently to the floor.

Riggan points the gun at Mike's head.

     Riggan points the gun at Lesley. Then at Mike. Finally, he puts
     the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger. PUM! And with the
     explosion, a fake blood mechanism splatters brains onto the
     stage. Riggan drops to the floor.

     A blackout. The audience applauds politely. The curtain falls.
     We follow Riggan off stage and into...

smiles plastered on their faces.

Lesley starts back for the wings, and Mike follows her. In the
background we see Riggan and Laura enter from the other side to
take their bows.

     smash everything on her dressing table. Then she looks in the

</b>               I'm pathetic. You know, I've dreamt of

               Your gun is ridiculous. It looks like a

               in the barrel.

     Mike is surprised to find Sam sitting on the cornice of the

leans over the railing and spits down toward the street.

      With a soft knock, Laura enters. She stands in the doorway with
      an odd expression on her face.

<b>                            RIGGAN
</b>                What now?
      Laura lays the Arts section of the New York Times down in front
      of Riggan.

<b>                          LAURA
</b>                Don't kill the messenger.

      Riggan picks up the paper. His expression immediately changes.
      Laura watches him sympathetically.

<b>                          LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>                He's an asshole.

      Now we see the cover of the Arts section. There is a picture
      of Mike lounging on a black sofa, his bare feet on a table as
      he sips a glass of wine. The Title of the article reads...
      "CARVING OUT HIS PLACE IN THEATER HISTORY. Shiner says Raymond
      Carver is the reason he became an actor." Riggan involuntarily
      squeezes the paper as he reads on, filling with rage.

<b>                          BIRDMAN (V.O.)
</b>                He's fooling you.

<b>                     RIGGAN
</b>          Shut up.

<b>                    LAURA
</b>              (Confused.)
          I didn't say anything.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          Fuck. This is it?
              (He passes a few pages.)
          This can't be it.
<b>                    LAURA
</b>          Page twelve.

Riggan searches desperately for page twelve. When he gets
there, he finds a huge ad of the new Toyota Camry that almost
fills the entire page, and down in the left corner a tiny
press release with the title:

"From Birdman to Carver: An aging Action Hero Grasps for His
Youth."

              (Flipping pages.)
          Where's the rest of it?

<b>                    LAURA
</b>          There is no rest of it.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          They didn't use the photo I sent them.

<b>                    LAURA
</b>          What photo?

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          The one you liked. The one you said
          I look like a young Jack Nicholson.

<b>                    LAURA

          Don't worry about it. Someone'll be using
          that to pick up dog shit tomorrow.

</b>               It won't be the first time I've been
               humiliated.

<b>                         RIGGAN
</b>               I bet it won't.

     Laura looks at him with fire in her eyes.

<b>                         LAURA
</b>               You're an asshole.
     She charges to the door and is about to leave when she turns
     back to Riggan...

<b>                         LAURA (CONT'D)

               one thing you don't have to worry about.

     She leaves, slamming the door behind her.

     Riggan remains still. Mike seems to be smirking at him right
     through the cover of the Arts section...

<b>                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)

     Riggan charges out of the room and into...

<b>31   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          31

     ...the hallway. He walks to Mike's dressing room, finds the

     ...discovering Mike lying in a sun bed. His arm is sticking

     Riggan yanks the sun bed open. Mike is asleep, wearing tiny
     sun goggles. Riggan slams the lid down on him.

Riggan slaps Mike on the arm.

          great actor's, pal. But you are not one of
          them.

Mike storms out of the room. Riggan follows him into...

     Riggan stares intensely into Mike's eyes. Mike looks away.

          why? Because at least when he was beating
          us, he wasn't thinking about taking us out

Mike's expression changes.

          you want to kneel down and unbuckle my
          belt? Or do you want me to take it off and
          use it?" I learned how to make myself numb.
          But my sister-- (Holding back tears.) My
          little sister...

Riggan can't go on. Mike is horrified.

<b>                    MIKE

          up.) I can pretend too, you little dick!

Riggan shoves Mike violently.

<b>                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)

</b>          Working with Riggan Thomson is like
          waltzing with a monkey?

He smacks Mike in the head with the paper and begins to jump in
front of him, ready to fight.

</b>          Let's go. Put your hands up.

     Riggan punches him on the face. Mike needs a few seconds to
     understand what has just happened. Then they begin to wrestle
     in the hallway. Mike breaks free from the headlock.

               after you get rid of me?

     a make-up box on the table and, points his finger at it, and
     sends it flying across the room.

               that's left is "you". A sad, selfish,
               mediocre actor, grasping--

     Riggan points his finger and sends the poster flying, spearing
     it on a coat rack, piercing Birdman right through the heart.
     Finally, silence. Until...

<b>                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
</b>               What the hell did you do that for? I liked
               that poster.

     A confused Riggan looks over to the wall, where the lamp on the
     floor is creating a shadow of his figure. Only in the shadow, it
     appears as if Riggan is wearing the Birdman costume. Stunned,
     Riggan slowly lifts one arm and in the shadow we see a wing.

<b>                         BIRDMAN (V.O.)
</b>               It's always 'we' brother.

     The television turns on by itself, playing an episode of the
     original Birdman cartoon. Riggan points his fingers at the tv
     and sends it hurling at the shadow. Then he proceeds to
     destroy everything in his room with his telekinetic powers.

     We slowly pan to see that, behind Riggan, Jake stands on the
     other side of the half-opened door. We push in on Jake,
     watching in shock. The camera turns and becomes Jake's POV...

<b>35   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                          35
</b>
     ...and now, from his view, we see Riggan yelling at the shadow.

<b>                         RIGGAN
</b>               Fuck you! Fuck you!

     He picks up a chair and throws it down. He then picks up the
     newspaper from the floor and tossing it all around. And now we
     understand that he is not using telepathy. He has been using
     only his hands. Completely mad. As Riggan turns to pick up
     something else, he spots Jake on the other side of the door. He
     immediately calms himself and walks over.

          The, uh, money came through. I just have to
          transfer it to the account.

          You know I'm proud of you, right? This took
          balls. And you did it.

Riggan nods. An exhausted sadness in his eyes.

          think they're laughing at me.

          block line of people waiting to see you.
          We are sold out. It's a full house.

          with one of his wives. And... I wasn't

Riggan smiles. He has forgotten about his existential doubts.
A worried Jake closes the door. He walks a few steps and
finds Laura and Lesley. They've been listening to his
conversation with Riggan.

          I'll better invest in a taco truck, or
          a strip joint near the airport.

Laura leaves. We follow Lesley up to Riggan's dressing room.
She knocks on the door. Nothing. Silence. She half-opens the
door and, from behind her, we see Riggan examining his right
hand. He has blood falling from the palm to the wrist.

He cleans his hand against his trousers.

Lesley nods. A beat.

     She looks at him with tender eyes. Then we follow her along
     the corridor until she passes by Mike's dressing room. Mike
     half-opens the door and sees Lesley walking by. He has a
     black eye. He waits for Lesley to be completely gone, and
     then he comes out of his dressing room and we follow him up
     the stairs to...

     at the street.

Mike, Lesley and Laura in the kitchen.
<b>                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
</b>          When we were done, we wrapped them in
          full body casts. The husband was
          depressed. Even when I told him his
          wife was gonna pull through, he was
          still depressed. So, I got up to his
          mouth hole and asked him, and he told
          me it was because he couldn't see her
          through the eye holes. Can you imagine?
          I'm telling you, the man's heart was
          breaking because he couldn't turn his
          goddamn head and see his goddamn wife.

<b>                    LESLEY
</b>              (In genuine tears.)
          That's terrible. (Beat.) Perfect.
          And terrible.

She is crushed. Laura holds Lesley, trying to control her own
emotion.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>              (Taking this in.)
          Yeah. So I guess what we have to
          ask ourselves is... What do we talk
          about when we talk about love?

The lights go to a blackout and the audience applauds as some
scene change music plays. As we follow Riggan off stage, the
lights are turned on again, but now they have an orange mood.
Lesley is the only one on stage, doing a monologue.

<b>                    LESLEY
</b>          Mel and I have been together five
          years, been married for four. But
          it was Ed who taught me something
          no one else could... He taught me
          what it felt like to really feel
          loved. And the terrible thing is
          that if something happened to Mel
          or myself, if something happened to
          either one of us tomorrow, I think
          the other one would grieve for a
          while, you know, but then would go

</b>           out and love again, have someone
           else soon enough. All this-- All of
           this love we're talking about... it
           would just be a memory. Maybe not
           even a memory. Am I wrong? I mean,
           I don't know anything. And I'm the
           first one to admit it.

A Dresser waits in the wings to help Riggan with his change.

<b>                     DRESSER
</b>           That was amazing!

Riggan looks proud. Things are finally going well. He undresses
to his underwear and puts on a robe and his moccasins, as the
stage begins to revolve. Laura, in costume, walks up beside
him. Over the following dialogue, the kitchen gives way to the
extravagant garden set we saw before.

<b>                     LAURA
</b>               (A bit distant.)
           It's actually going well.

<b>                     RIGGAN
</b>           Yeah. (A beat.) Hey. I think we have to
           talk.

<b>                     LAURA
</b>               (Sad smile.)
           No. We don't.

Riggan nods.

<b>                     RIGGAN
</b>           Right. (Beat.) We will eventually,
           though, `cause that's the only way I get
           to say I'm sorry. I really am.

Silence.

<b>                     LAURA
</b>           We could've made good parents.

<b>                     RIGGAN
</b>           Horrible. We would've been just--

<b>                     LAURA
</b>           Awful. Would have raised, like...

<b>                     LAURA
</b>           ...or Justin Bieber.

</b><b>                         LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>               I'm not really the housewife type anyway. I
               thought I could be a mom. My body seems to
               disagree.

     The lights come up and Laura walks onto the stage.

<b>                         LAURA (CONT'D)
</b>                   (Back to him.)
               You were right. This was fun.
     Riggan watches her go, but something else grabs his attention.
     We pan across the stage to see Sam and Mike on the other side.
     They talk and laugh. Sam kisses Mike softly. Mike playfully
     grabs her ass.

     We pan back to Riggan. His expression morphs from broken-
     hearted to rage. He marches over to a stage hand.
<b>                         RIGGAN
</b>               You have a cigarette?

     The stage hand holds out a pack, Riggan takes one.

<b>                         STAGE HAND
</b>               You need a light?

     Riggan snatches the lighter and storms out through the hallway,
     and out the back door of the theater to...

<b>41   EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS         41
</b>
     ...the alley. Down at the end, we can see the tourists making
     their way about the streets. Riggan lights the cigarette and
     leans back against the stage door trying to calm himself.

<b>                         RIGGAN
</b>               Breathing in, I calm myself. Breathing out,
               I ease myself.

     But this is New York City. A fluorescent light buzzes above his
     head. Taxis honk their horns. The sound of pedestrians yelling
     at one another. All fueling his agitation.
     Riggan checks his watch. He pulls one last drag from the
     cigarette before he tosses it, and turns to head back in, only
     to realize the door has locked. He tries to pull it open to no
     avail. He begins to knock loudly on the door. There is no
     response. He knocks louder. Nothing.

     He is turning to walk away when he realizes that his robe is
     caught in the door. He checks his watch again and now is
     beginning to panic. He tries to tear at the robe but the terry
     cloth is too strong for him to rip. Frantically, he looks around
     for an answer. No answer. No time. He pulls the robe off of him

</b>
     and, wearing only his underwear and moccasins, he charges down
     the alley way toward...

<b>42   EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                      42
</b>
     ...the street. Now, rushing down the block in his underwear. A
     tourist spots him.

<b>                         TOURIST
</b>               Hey, aren't you...?

</b>               Riggan Thompson! Holy Shit! Let me get an
               autograph.

     Riggan marches on as a few more people begin to notice. The
     Tourist runs in front of him, forcing him to stop.

<b>                         TOURIST (CONT'D)
</b>               Come on, man. Don't be a dick. Let me have
               an autograph.

     The man produces a pen and a magazine from his pocket. More
     people begin to gather...

<b>                          MAN ON STREET
</b>               Birdman!

     Seeing no other way out, Riggan signs the autograph.

<b>                         TOURIST
</b>               Dude! You fuckin' rock!

     Directly in front of him stand a lady and her two kids.

</b>               Can we take one picture?

</b>
     Riggan tries to get past them, but a crowd has formed. A swarm
     of cell phones begin to glow like fireflies.

<b>                         LADY

</b>               Give me a fucking break, lady.

     The kids run up next to him. Even more people crowding around.
     Riggan puts up his middle finger, just as the Lady takes the
     shot. He shoves the kids aside and moves on.

     Riggan pushes through the crowd to get to the lobby. The people
     begin to chant. Dozens of cell phones recording him.

     head wrapped in a bandage. A man in a suit next to him.

</b>
     ...the theater. Riggan stands in the back among the audience.
     He sees the "rain" falling on the stage. The "Motel" sign is
     lit. Mike and Lesley are in bed, for the motel scene, waiting
     for the knock on the door. With nothing else to do, Riggan
     yells his line from the back of the auditorium...

<b>                         RIGGAN
</b>               Knock knock knock! Terri! Terri!

     The audience turns to see Riggan standing in his underwear.
     They begin to murmur and laugh and point at him.
     Riggan marches down the aisle. He looks haggard and covered
     with perspiration.

     Lesley and Mike, confused, come out of bed.

<b>                         LESLEY
</b>               Ed! What are you doing here?

     Giggles from the audience. Riggan turns threateningly and points
     to an audience member on the aisle who is giggling at him.

<b>                          RIGGAN (CONT'D)
</b>               Shut up!

     The guy stops smiling. The audience goes silent. Riggan arrives
     at the apron of the stage. Annie from the wings slides the gun
     towards him. Riggan grabs it and points it at Mike.

     He goes out one of the exits and we are left with the silence of
     the empty hallway. After a few seconds, the sound of the gunshot
     from the scene echoes through the theater. The audience
     applauds. The camera starts to move forward. A few seconds later
     Riggan takes over the POV with his bloody long wig and the fake
     gun. We follow up to...

<b>46   INT. RIGGAN'S DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS             46

     ...his dressing room. He puts on a robe. He walks to his
     refrigerator without acknowledging Sam who is sitting on the
     couch, scribbling her dashes on the toilet paper once again.
     Riggan takes out a plastic container of bologna and a jar of
     mustard. He sits in front of his dressing table, peels open the
     bologna and opens the jar of mustard. Slice by slice, he dips
     the bologna in the mustard and shoves it into his mouth.

He continues to eat. She tries to fill the odd silence.

          able to get through a performance
          without a raging fire... or a raging
          hard-on. I'm not really sleeping, you
          know, at all. And I'm pretty much broke.
          Oh, and also, this play feels like a
          miniature, deformed version of myself

Silence. Riggan notices the toilet paper.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          What are you doing? Some homework?

<b>                    SAM
</b>          No. I don't-- When I was in rehab, they
          made us do this.

She unravels the roll and we see that there are thousands of
black marks running along the toilet paper. She takes the last
two panels and tears them off.
<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)

              (Beat.)
          I guess they were trying to remind us
          that that's what all our egos and self-
          obsession are worth.

Riggan stares at the paper, and then at Sam.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>              (Casually.)

He stops chewing and stares out.

</b>          Fine... You're right. I am just
          "fine". Adorably mediocre.

He smiles to her sadly, and then he wipes the mustard from his
face with the piece of toilet paper.

Sam looks at the ruined toilet paper in his hands.

<b>                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh... Shit. I'm sorry.

</b>              (Smiling.)
          It's okay. You just destroyed the entire
          human race in one blow.

Riggan looks at her with the saddest of expressions.

          you're becoming a trending topic?

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          Really? What does that mean?

Sam searches for something on her iPhone and then hands it to
Riggan. Riggan looks at the phone and sees a hand-held video of
himself in the streets in his underwear.

Riggan looks at more footage, seemingly confused. After a
moment, the phone vibrates and the video is interrupted by a
text message, which reads "Truth or Dare?"

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          It's for you.

She grabs the phone and looks at the screen. Then at her
father. Riggan is staring at her. She looks down.

<b>                    RIGGAN (CONT'D)

</b>          Go.

A sympathetic smile. An understanding. Sam exits.

Riggan stares into the mirror absently. His eyes locked on
his reflection trying to find himself in the image. Then he
spots a vase with dying roses, the same roses he flung to the
ground previously.

     He gets up and goes into the bathroom. He pulls off the long
     wig and the mustache. He washes his face. Then he opens a
     small bottle and uses the liquid to scrub his goatee. The
     dark dye begins to run out, leaving only white hair. For the
     first time we see that Riggan has a white beard.

     He puts on new clothes and comes out of the bathroom. He grabs
     a beige raincoat and heads out of the dressing room and
     into...

<b>47   INT. HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS                            47

     ...the hallway. As he passes by Mike's door he can hear Sam and
     Mike. They're trying to be as quiet as possible, but we can hear
     them flirting and laughing.

     He pauses for a moment but continues on. After a few seconds,
     his phone vibrates. He looks at it. A text from Jake reads:
     "Have you seen this??? Awesome!!!" He clicks the attachment and
     sees the, now infamous, video of his underwear escapade in the
     street. We zoom in until the image fills the screen, when we
     finally pull away, we discover that...

</b>     ...Riggan's video is being played now in a television in the
     bar. We see the MTV logo on the bottom of the screen and a video
     caption that reads: "Birdman goes viral, 930.000 views and
     counting". The camera pans to find Riggan sitting at the bar,
     drunk. He is one of the few customers. He polishes off his
     drink.
<b>                         RIGGAN

<b>                         BARTENDER
</b>               You got it.

     The bartender pours another whiskey for Riggan. A waiter steps
     up to the bar. The bartender points to a martini.

<b>                         BARTENDER (CONT'D)
</b>                   (To the waiter.)
               That's going over to Ms. Dickinson.

     Riggan's head tilts at the mention of the name. He looks over to
     see Tabitha sitting at a table, scratching in her notebook.

<b>                         RIGGAN

</b>
The waiter pockets the money and gives Riggan the drink. He
walks it over to Tabitha and places it down in front of her. Not
looking up, she pulls the drink closer and takes a sip.

Riggan sits down across from her. She looks up and immediately
recognizes him. He takes out the Carver cocktail napkin and
pushes it in front of her. She looks at him, and then down to
the napkin. She reads it in silence.

table.

      over and gulps down Tabitha's entire martini, gin pouring out
      the sides of his mouth. Unaware, he slams the empty martini

      furiously. Riggan keeps walking until he arrives at a bench,
      with a tree behind. Everything is quiet. Riggan sits on the

      The camera flies up with Riggan as he floats above the street.
      There is something magical in his ascension, gently impelled by
      the breeze. A beautiful backlight makes his body glow. Birdman
      flutters around him.

      A strange light suddenly palpitates in Riggan's eyes. Something
      makes sense in what Birdman is telling him.

      The camera becomes Riggan's POV. He looks down to see the
      people on the street, watching him in awe.

      And as the camera pulls away, we discover Birdman is gone and
      Riggan is standing on the ledge of a tall building. The camera
      tilts down and we see that more people have gathered around,
      and more cars has stopped, and they all point at Riggan,
      worried about the situation.

      A guy wearing shorts, a Bob Marley t-shirt and a robe opens his
      window, one floor below Riggan, and looks up at him.

The guy goes inside his apartment.

<b>                    RIGGAN

Now, from the door of the rooftop, a good neighbor calmly
approaches Riggan.

<b>                    GOOD NEIGHBOR
</b>          Hi, sir. Can I help you? You should be

          Music.

Some underscoring music begins to sound. The neighbor is now
close to him and helps Riggan step down from the edge on to the
floor of the rooftop.

</b>          Are you alright? Do you want me to
          call someone? Do you know where to go?

Riggan closes his eyes for a moment as the camera moves slowly
toward him. He opens his eyes. The music begins to swell. Riggan
stands up straight and proud, and in a voice that sounds like
Birdman...

<b>                    RIGGAN

      like a superhero. We fly next to him, and we can see below the
      spectacular sight that is Manhattan, until...

      The confused Usher watches him go by, as he points to the
      street. We pan to see a taxi driver coming out of his car,
      running like a mad man toward us.

      take it inside the lobby, but we remain out front.

      Day turns to night, igniting the lights   of the marquee, which

          Above the title, in smaller print, "Riggan Thomson and Mike
          Shiner". Below on a banner, "Opening Night".

</b>          I was in up to my chest when I felt the
          first one. On my back, like somebody was
          holding a frying pan against me. And then
          my chest, and my legs. The water was full
          of jellyfish. I fought my way out of the
          water, and I started rolling around the
          sand like a maniac... crying.

Sylvia doesn't know how to react.

     Riggan raises one hand to silence Mike. Mike looks at him,
     confused. His eyes narrow on the gun. There is no red plug.

     Dead silence. An eerie electricity in the theater.

smiles the most beautiful insane smile.

</b>          I don't exist. I'm not even here. I don't

tears, he aims the gun at Mike.

Again, no shot. Slowly, Riggan raises the gun toward his own
head, suddenly a frightening explosion. Blood sprays. Riggan
falls. We stay with the shell-shocked audience. A moment of
tension, of uncertainty, until...

One of the old Birdman films is playing on a small television

Show host appears. Behind him a picture of Riggan and a
caption that reads: "Nation in shock." A shot of a candle
vigil in Central park.

We pan away from the TV to see that the waiting room is
filled with newsmen waiting for something to happen. There is
almost no room to breath.

We pan to see Jake emerging from an elevator, carrying a
newspaper under his arm. He walks through the dense mass of
newsmen with a serious expression on his face. We follow him
into...

shoulder. Sylvia turns and we discover Sam standing in the
doorway holding a bouquet of flowers. A bit of awkward
silence, and Sylvia decides to leave them alone.

She kisses Sam on the head and exits. Sam walks the flowers
to Riggan at the bed. She lays them on his chest.

</b>          Thanks a lot.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          I'm just kidding. No, I'm not. You
          look hideous.
              (Working on phone.)
          You already have 80 thousand
          followers. In less than a day. And
          I'm about to scare the shit out of
          them.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          Let me see.
<b>                      SAM
</b>          No. Done.

A moment between them. Sam picks up the flowers and kisses
him tenderly on the head. Riggan is pleasantly surprised by
that kiss.

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Now, I'm going to find something to
          put these flowers in.

She heads out of the room. Riggan lies there for a moment,
tranquil. After a moment he reaches up and touches his
bandages. Finally, he climbs out of the bed. We follow him
into...


<b>INT. BATHROOM - ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
...the bathroom. He stands before the mirror. He stares at
his reflection for a few seconds, and slowly begins to remove
the bandages. We can see that Riggan's nose has been
reconstructed. It is a crooked, incomplete nose, like the one
Javier Bardem has.

<b>                    RIGGAN
</b>          I do look hideous.

In the reflection, Riggan sees Birdman sitting on the toilet.
They look at each other, but say nothing. Riggan puts the
bandages back on and we follow him out to...
<b>                                            10/29/14   /   112.
</b>
<b>INT. ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
...the room. He looks around, but Sam is gone. He ambles over
to the window, his ass hanging out of the back of his
hospital robe. He opens the window and feels the sun and the
breeze on his swollen face. We just hear the sounds of the
people standing down in the parking lot. Media trucks. Fans.
We stay with Riggan, who seems to be thinking about
something. He sees a flock of birds dancing in the sky. Then
he grabs the side of the window with one hand and begins to
step up onto the sill.
The camera pans away from him to a table that has some photos
propped on it: One of he and Sam when she was a child. One
with Sylvia and Sam. A copy of Carver's "What we talk About
When We Talk About Love" laying on the surface.

The camera continues to pan until it comes to the door. Sam
enters with a small vase. She looks around...

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Dad?

She goes to the bathroom and peers in... nothing.

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Dad...?

She spots the opened window and registers the sounds from
outside. Tentatively she walks toward the window. She gets
there, summons her courage and looks down. Nothing. Slowly,
confused, she tilts her head up and looks up into the sky. A
smile, filled with pride, begin to wash over her face.
