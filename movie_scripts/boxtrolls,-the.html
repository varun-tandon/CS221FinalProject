          The wind blows trash down the empty streets. Snatcher's
          vehicle, rattling from its boiler, prowls past with Snatcher
          still calling out his warning until the sound fades in the

          After Snatcher's truck has passed the CAMERA lands on: A
          MANHOLE. Carved in the heavy iron cover is a warning: "HERE
<b>          BE MONSTERS".
</b>                         
          A LONG BEAT OF SILENCE. The manhole cover slowly twists and
          lifts, a pudgy blue hand emerges. Two pairs of yellow,
          glowing eyes peer out. The creatures talk in expressive but
          unintelligible GURGLES. Down the street, two more manhole
          covers lift.
                         
          In pairs and in gangs, these BOXTROLLS -- so called for the
          cardboard boxes they wear -- emerge from the sewers and
          scurry through the streets of the besieged town. Their long,
          forboding SHADOWS creep across walls plastered with posters
          that read: "CHEESEBRIDGE: A GOUDA PLACE TO LIVE", "REDHATS -

          We watch them scurry through streets and alleyways, gurgling
          quiet directions to each other. They move swiftly and travel
          in packs. We see a lone boxtroll jump and pull himself in to
          his box as a DOG BARKS. He pops back out of his box and moves
          along quickly.
                         
          CLOSE ON: what appears to be a LARGE BOXTROLL MONSTER peering
          around the corner of a moonlight street. Its glowing eyes
          turn toward the camera as it sways slowly. Five more pairs of
          eyes light up within the large, boxy shadow and SIX BOXTROLLS
          separate from the mass, popping off to run their errands
          while the coast is clear.
                         
          BIRDS EYE VIEW: Groups of two and three boxtrolls snake their
          way down streets, skirting carefully around areas lit by
          street lamps.
                         
          In a small lane, groups of boxtrolls stop to collect
          mechanical stuff. They work together, using their boxes as
          tools and props.
                         
          SIX BOXTROLLS stack up in the background to steal a SHOP
          SIGN, while THREE BOXTROLLS cooperatively steal the WHEEL
          from a WOODEN CART.

          One boxtroll uses his box to prop up a       corner while the other
          two release the wheel from the axle. A       LONE BOXTROLL crosses
          the frame to see what treasures he may       find in a trash bin;
          as he knocks it over with a CLANG, TWO       BOXTROLLS scurry past
          and stack together, stealing the HOUSE       NUMBER from the front
          of a brownstone.
                         
          CLOSE ON: the boxtrolls' booty - the shiny brass number `2',
          the shop sign for `TIMELESS TIMEPIECES', the wheel that rolls
          along between two boxtrolls.
                         
          Six other boxtrolls on the hunt stack together against a
          fence. We watch as one boxtroll makes it over the top,
          cooperatively pulling the others into the alley behind him.

          Two BOXTROLL HANDS wriggle into view over the rubbish, fill
          of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, an APPLE CORE, a BANANA PEEL, and a
          FISH CARCASS. The boxtroll gurgles "EWW" and "BLECH" sounds
          as he moves these unwanted items aside. He gurgles with joy
          when a bit of brass is revealed.
                         
          FISH, a nervous 4-foot tall, wonky-toothed, pointy-eared,
          gangly-limbed boxtroll, pulls an old broken ALARM CLOCK from
          the trash barrel. He is in a large alley, filled with old
          boxes, crates, broken items and tarps strewn about.
                         
          Fish stares curiously at the object, turning it over in his
          hands and holding it to his ear, listening. He shakes the
          clock and hears loose gears RATTLE.

          Fish opens the clock face        and gurgles, intently toying with
          the mechanical interior.         After a moment, the clock begins to
          TICK with activity. Fish         gurgles excitedly and closes the
          clock face, holding it to        his ear to listen to the rhythmic
          ticking.

          Shoe, short and feisty, grabs the alarm clock from Fish and
          scampers away with it. Fish watches as Shoe climbs a stack of
          crates and hisses back at him, sniffing at his new prize.
          Fish scowls at Shoe and returns to the rubbish pile, shaking
          his head and muttering.
                         
          Behind him a half-dozen boxtrolls methodically pick through
          an assortment of trash barrels and old boxes. It's like a
          troop of monkeys at the dump. They find mechanical stuff,
          inspect it, and then either drop it into their box to keep or
          toss it back into the trash.
                         
          A filthy TEDDY BEAR WITH A MUSICAL KEY is discarded by
          another boxtroll, landing with a THUNK and A FEW TINNY
          MUSICAL NOTES. Fish turns excitedly.

          He picks up the teddy bear and cranks a key in its back as
          Shoe toys with the stolen alarm clock. The teddy bear plays
          MUSIC. Fish gurgles along to the tune and bobs his head,
          enjoying the moment.
                         
          Again, Shoe notices Fish has found something interesting. He
          shoves the alarm clock into his box, stealthily sneaks up on
          Fish and makes a grab for the teddy bear! Fish refuses to let
          go and they squabble over it. Suddenly all the boxtrolls snap
          to attention, their ears alert--

          All the boxtrolls hide in their boxes. The "camouflage"
          works. Their boxes fit in perfectly with the trash barrels
          and packing crates.

          Winnie scrunches her face slightly, focusing intently on the
          figure.
                         
          The shape creeps a little closer. A hunched-over silhouette,
          with glowing round eyes. It's a boxtroll monster!
                         
          Winnie gasps. She stays put and turns her head to the side,
          screwing up her face with curiosity as the figure stands
          upright.

          The figure takes another step towards her. REVEAL it is Eggs.
          He lifts his goggles. The light from the street lamp reveals
          his face. He is guarded but curious and mimics Winnie's
          expression.

          Trout tosses the hat back to Pickles, teasing Snatcher as a

          CUT TO a wider view of Market Square as Winnie, Pickles, and
          Trout play keep away with the white hat, tossing it around

          The hat is caught by Winnie. Snatcher chases her, corners her
          and is about to crush her with the arm when the gears GRIND
          in protestation.
                         
          CUT TO Eggs, Shoe, and Oil Can on the mecha arm joint. They
          sneer at Snatcher. Shoe giggles as he removes a final gear

          Pickles blinks.

</b>                    Like that, just there, me blinking.
                    That would've taken them a day.
                         
          The camera keeps pulling out and lights and the stage table
          can be seen.

</b>                    I mean, none of them are going
                    home. They're having to do this
                    bit. And now this bit. And this
                    bit. I mean, this should stop.

                    free will.

</b>                    It's too much. And then they'd have
                    had to've done me talking about the
                    blink. And it never ends. I think
                    they make a meal of it, to be
                    honest. I don't know how they get
                    the time. They've got to have other
                    jobs. It's more like a hobby.
                    Y'know, like stamp collecting,
                    something you do in your free time.
