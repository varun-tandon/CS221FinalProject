          Rain taps on George's hood sounding to his ears like rain on
          a shed roof, a comforting almost cozy sound. The buckles of
          his galoshes make a merry jingle as he goes.
                         
          The boat whistles past a blockade of sawhorses marked DEPT OF
          DERRY PUBLIC WORKS, where a gouge in the blacktop sends it
          sweeping diagonally across toward a STORM DRAIN.
                         
          George races after, trying to grab the boat before it's

          The PAPER BOAT surfs up to the drain, circles around twice,

          Will opens the door, rickety stairs leading down into
          darkness, the weeper somewhere in the recesses, along with
          the steady sound of a LEAK.
                         
          Steeling himself, Will descends. He gets to the last few
          rungs and is thrown off for a moment seeing HIS REFLECTION in
          the basement floor, as if it were A BLACK MIRROR. He realizes

          Will looks up toward the leak/weeping sound and sees, curled
          in the same corner where we had that opening POV...
                         
<b>          GEORGE IN HIS YELLOW SLICKER.

          Rain rolling off him like he's still in a storm flooding the
          cellar. He looks up at Will.
                         
<b>                                             GEORGE

          Will moves to step into the water when he hesitates, holding
          his foot over it. He looks to Georgie whose expression of
          distress seems insincere.

          Will grabs a rake from the wall and pokes its tip into the
          water. It's a good six inches deep.

          Water and muck pour from his mouth as he says these last
          words, an endless cascade.
                         
          Will recoils. Georgie glides over the water towards Will, and
          we realize there is a creature beyond it, the colors of a
          clown's costume, PENNYWISE, propping up Georgie's body like a
<b>          MEAT PUPPET.
</b>                         
          Horrified, Will races up the stairs as...
                         
          PENNYWISE crosses the flooded basement and scuffles up the
          steps after Will, arms and legs splayed out like a charging
          crocodile, Georgie's limp corpse strapped to his back.
                         
          Will slams the door on Pennywise's/Georgie's gross face.

          Will slams the door of his room and hides in his bed.
          Panting. The DOOR KNOB starts to rattle.
                         
          Drip. Will looks up. The leak from the ceiling getting
          worse. The DOOR KNOB rattles even more. Shaking until it
          seems like its going to fall off.
                         
          Silence. Will approaches the door. He grabs a baseball bat
          and prepares to attack. Swinging open the door, ready to
          swing... it's his FATHER.

          Will and Zach stand over the stairwell. Zach turns the light
          on and walks down, much to Will's horror, into a puddle of

          that cover a window to the basement slips to the ground.

          The fight is getting desperate. Both Will and Mike bleed
          from rock hits. Will, Richie, and Mike see Bev waving them
          to come. They run for their lives towards the house, Travis

          don't want to find yourself in, ever. Scummy yellow water
          stained wallpaper peeling like dead skin from walls. Sconces
          hanging from their sockets and detritus is built up on the
          wooden floor boards. No footprints anywhere.
                         
          Ben sticks his head out. He looks left, nothing, he looks

          Heroux walks past a piano being played, whispers something
          into the players ear, then throws the change from his meal --
          $1.85 -- onto the piano top. The piano player tips his hat

          his severed hand remaining on the table.
                         
          At the bar somebody calls for more beer. The bartender takes

          down again. A second chop finishes him.
                         
          Floyd, writhing under the table, gropes for his hand on the
          table above it. Heroux chops his other hand off, Floyd
          screams even louder.
                         
          Laughter from the bar as patrons rub the bartender's bald
          head for luck. The piano playing only gets more giddy and

          Heroux turns to Ed Katook, who struggles to pull his clutch
          pistol from its shoulder holster. He slings the ax sideways
          just as Katook gets the pistol out, burying it in his back.

          Fat Eddie King falls to the floor trying to crab away from

          tree, rocking it back and forth. It finally comes free and he
          brings it down again.

          Eddie's severed head goes rolling over toward the bar, right
          to the foot of a drunk, who without breaking his call for
          another drink, kicks it away.
                         
          In back, Heroux turns to the last man cowering in the corner:
          Stugley Grenier. He takes a swing and Stugley ducks it, ax
          splintering the floor.
                         
          Stugley scrambles into the OUTHOUSE and closes the door
          behind. Heroux, now totally slicked with blood, stalks over
          and begins chopping his way in.
                         
          He finds the windowless room empty. A sound comes from deep
          in the pooping hole. He looks down just in time to see...
                         
          Stugley's boots disappear through the pool of shit and piss.
                         
          Heroux steps out of the outhouse into the carnage of the back
          room. Exhausted and bloody from tip to toe, he takes a seat
          at the card table, props his ax next to him, and starts
          drinking what's left of the slaughtered men's beers.
                         
          No one in the saloon seems to pay much mind to this. No one
          except Pennywise at the piano, who takes great pleasure in
          the scene and the ditty he's playing, a greasy white smile on
          his giddy, evil face...

          From under Stan the ORANGE EYE APPEARS, the dark water around
          him suddenly aglow. He looks down into it and it becomes
          clear the eye is really a mouth, and the orange is coming
          from deep inside its bowels -- THE DEADLIGHTS.
                         
          Stan looks directly into them and is mesmerized, so much so
          that he stops swimming.

          Paralyzed, Stan starts to sink toward the deadlights when
          Mike, shielding his eyes, grabs Stan and swims him back to
          the surface.
                         
          All the kids give cover with their weapons -- shooting
          flares, swinging the sledgehammer, impaling with the stake,
          using the hubcap as a shield -- so that Mike, helped by Ben
          and Eddie, can drag Stan onto the island.

          Will shimmies down about 5 feet of rope and lights a car
          flare, illuminating the chamber in a blood red pall. The
          walls inside are rough, like the surface of a meteor.
                         
          Directly under the trapdoor is a fountain like hole in the
          floor open to the reflecting pool. Floating on the water is

          The trapdoor slams shut and slices the rope. Will falls to
          the floor, flare falling into the water. It dims but doesn't
          go out.
                         
          It's near PITCH BLACK. Just Will and Pennywise. He can hear

          see anything.
                         
          There's scuffling all around him. Close. Will dives into
          the water for the flare. Rises. Sweeps it around.

          waves it this way and that, illuminating the dark in front of

          lunging at the kids one last time. IT finally gives up,
          slumping to the floor dead, a black charred clownish corpse.

          the ceiling of the stone crypt. Bev almost falls out into
          space, caught by Ben just in time.
                         
          The water from the waterfalls and from the reflecting pool

          They pull out of the driveway, camera on Will's lap. Zach and
          Sharon smile back affectionately from the front seat.
                         
          Will turns to see his friends wave bon voyage with their
          SCARRED HANDS. A reminder of an oath to be kept.
