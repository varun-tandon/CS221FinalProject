</b>
<b>               GRAPHIC:  1967 - SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA
</b>
               It is set against the obvious skyline of Las Vegas.

<b>               INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY
</b>
               The lair is 1960's high-tech.  We see a huge oversized 
               conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES, 
               including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket 
               and turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID.

<b>               ANGLE ON:  A RING WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE RINGED

                         Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good.  
                         As you know, my plot to high-jack 
                         nuclear weapons and hold the world 
                         hostage has failed.  Again.  This 
                         organization will not tolerate 
                         failure.

               He presses a button.  The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic 
               doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip

               back and fall into a pit.  Their chairs return empty and 
               smoking.

                         you to help me rid the world of the 
                         only man who can stop me now.  We 
                         must go to London.  I've set a trap 
                         for Austin Powers!

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY
</b>
               MUSIC:  Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES.

               We start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet 
               pants walking down the street in rhythm, à la Saturday Night 
               Fever.

               We pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of 
               Mystery.  He's a swinger, with

               medium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National 
               Health Services glasses.

               Austin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs.  It is 
               that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies.

               Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to 
               a MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus.

               Austin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO 
               BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all 
               start to twist to the music, including the Bobby.

</b>
               In the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently 
               to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area.

               One wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit.  One wears a 
               metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl.  The other wears 
               a see-through Mary Quant dress.

<b>                                     AUSTIN

                         for me baby.  Smashing!

               We see that AUSTIN HAS VERY BAD ENGLISH TEETH.  The model in 
               the stewardess outfit foes on all fours.

<b>                                     AUSTIN
</b>                         Crazy baby.  Give me some shoulder.  
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         No.  No.

               Show me love.  Yes!  And...done.  Here you go, luv.  I'm 
               spent.

               Austin throws the camera in the air behind him.  An ASSISTANT 
               scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground.

<b>                                     AUSTIN

                         this time.

                         We could have another photo session 
                         back at my flat.

</b>                         So many women, so little time.

               A gaggle of MOD GIRLS come towards the shoot site.  They 
               recognize Austin and SCREAM hysterically.

<b>                                     MOD GIRL 1
</b>                         It's Austin Powers!

               Austin runs away.  The mob chases after him a la Hard Day's 
               Night.

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET
</b>
               Two BAD GUYS attack Austin.  He JUDO CHOPS them.

<b>                                     AUSTIN
</b>                         Judo chop!  Judo chop!

               The mob of girls catches up to Austin and he runs away.

<b>               EXT.  PHONE BOOTH
</b>
               Austin's in a phone booth with his back turned.  The mob 
               runs by.  He steps out, disguised only by a beard.

<b>               EXT.  GUARD STATION - LONDON - DAY
</b>
               Austin is jiving down the street and comes across a stoned-
               face red-coated BUCKINGHAM PALAM GUARD standing at attention 
               just outside his guard box.

               Austin mugs for the guard, trying to get him to crack up, 
               but to no avail.  Finally, he pulls a big sixties FLOWER 
               from behind the guard's head and presents it to him.  They 
               both crack up.

<b>               EXT.  PHOTO BOOTH
</b>
               The girls run by a Sixties-era photo booth with somebody 
               inside.  Austin steps out.

<b>               ANGLE ON THE FILM STRIP
</b>
               Panels 1-3 show Austin with various exotic MODELS.  The fourth 
               panel shows Austin with the QUEEN.

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET
</b>
               Austin spots a VERY PREGNANT HIPPY GIRL with a placard that 
               says "PROTEST!" in a funky font.

<b>                                     AUSTIN
</b>                         You might want to protest a bit louder 
                         next time, luv.

               The both laugh.

<b>               2L  FULL SCREEN INSERT - AUSTIN'S PASSPORT
</b>
               The passport opens.  We see Austin's dour photo.  Then he 
               gives an insane grin, showing his bad teeth.  The page flips 
               and we see visa stamps from all the exotic places he's been.

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY
</b>
               Austin flips a coin into a BLIND MAN's cup.  The blind man, 
               obviously sighted, moves the cup to catch the coin.  Austin 
               wags his finger in a "oh, you" fashion, and then proceeds to 
               knee him the balls.

<b>               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY
</b>
               Austin is being chased around the corner by a GAGGLE OF 
<b>               SCHOOLGIRLS.
</b>
               After a moment, Austin returns from around the corner with a 
               baton, followed by a MARCHING BAND.

               The schoolgirls pick up his trail again and he begins to 
               run.

               A 1967 Jaguar XKE convertible, which is decorated with a 
               large Union Jack, pulls beside Austin.

               He jumps over the door into the moving convertible, racing 
               off just ahead of the crowd.

<b>               EXT./INT.  JAGUAR - STREETS OF LONDON - DAY
</b>
               The driver of the Jag is Austin's associate, MRS. KENSINGTON, 
               a beautiful woman in her thirties.

               They drive against obvious REAR PROJECTION of 1960's London.

</b>                         Hello, Austin Just then, a FLASHING 
                         RED LIGHT goes off and we hear a 
                         distinctive PHONE RING.

<b>                                     MRS. KENSINGTON

                         of British Intelligence.

               The glove compartment revolves to reveal a picture phone.  
               ANGLE ON:  PICTURE PHONE SCREEN.  We see BASIL EXPOSITION a 
               distinguished older man.  A desk plate reads:  "Basil

                         received word that Dr. Evil, the

                         Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's 
                         planning a trap for you tonight at

               The assassin comes to and leaps to his feet.

               Mrs. Kensington knocks his feet from under him.  The assassin 
               hits the ground and pulls out a dagger.  Mrs. Kensington

</b>                         I went to Oxford and excelled in 
                         several subjects, but I ended up 
                         specializing in foreign languages.

                         exciting career, but my job was to 
                         read everything printed in every 
                         country.  It's very boring.  My whole

                         essence a sophisticated heat beam 
                         which we called a "laser."  Using 
                         this laser, we punch a hole in the 
                         protective layer around

               the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer."  Slowly 
               but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the 
               risk of skin cancer.  That is, unless the world pays us a 
               hefty ransom.

               MUSIC:  "What the World Needs Now" by BURT BACHARACH Austin 
               looks at his address book.  ANGLE ON THE PAGE:  We see a 
               list of names crossed out, with

               comments written in beside them.  Beside Jimi Hendrix we see 
               "Deceased, Drugs"; Janis Joplin, "Deceased, Alcohol"; Mama 
               Cass, "Deceased, Ham Sandwich"; Jerry Garcia. "Deceased, 
               Gratefully"; Jane Fonda, "Square".

               Austin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers.  
               He picks up his new pair&amp;emdash; REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER 
               PUMPS.  He pumps them too much and they explode.

               Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below.  We 
               see the CDs he's just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER'S 
               and BURT BACHARACH'S GREATEST HITS.

               Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened 
               Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on.  It 
               explodes in a shower of sparks and soup.

               He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle.  The 
               NOISE is awful.

               Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III.  His fighter gets his head 
               ripped off, and blood spews out.

               Austin is genuinely frightened by this.

               Austin drinks by himself while a gaggle of EIGHT CONTEMPORARY 
               YOUNG PEOPLE IN LOVE cavort.  They look at him like he's a 
               freak.

               Austin raises a bottle of ZIMA as if to say "hey, I'm down 
               with that".  They shoot him sarcastic peace signs.  Austin 
               is pleased.

</b>                         Very well, where should I begin?  My 
                         father was a relentlessly self-
                         improving boulangerie owner from 
                         Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy 
                         and a penchant for buggery.  My mother 
                         was a fifteen-year-old French 
                         prostitute named Chloe with webbed 
                         feet.  My father would womanize, he 
                         would drink, he would make outrageous 
                         claims, like he invented the question 
                         mark.  Sometimes he would accuse 
                         chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of 
                         general malaise that only the genius 
                         possess and the insane lament.  My 
                         childhood was typical.

               Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we'd make 
               meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap 
               bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the 
               age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the

               age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically 
               shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn 
               scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical 
               school.  From there...

               ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP.  They are stunned.

                         of many items you'll find right in 
                         your own home.  We make steel, 
                         volatile chemicals, petroleum-based 
                         products, and we also own the Franklin

                              (holds up plate)
                         Some plates, like the Gone With The 
                         Wind series, have gone up in value 
                         as much as two-hundred and forty 
                         percent, but, as with any investment, 
                         there is some risk involved.

                         range of Virtucon licensed products.  
                         On the right, you'll notice a door 
                         that leads to a restricted area.  
                         Only authorized personnel are allowed

               All the tourists head for the gift shop.  Austin notices a 
               SEVEN-FOOT-TALL SCIENTIST leaving the "RESTRICTED AREA" with 
               a FOUR-HUNDRED-POUND FEMALE SCIENTIST.  They both wear 
               Virtucon coveralls.

               The seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men's room; 
               the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room.  Austin 
               and Vanessa follow.

               We hear from inside either washroom the sound of PEOPLE BEING

               Austin and Vanessa exit wearing the scientists' coveralls 
               over their clothes.  Magically, the coveralls fit perfectly.   
               They go through the doors into the restricted area.

                         travels to India.  I learned it from

                         chaste man who mysteriously died of 
                         a disease that had all the hallmarks

               Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental 
               floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo.  
               He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches 
               like a grappling hook.

               Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack.  
               Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the 
               sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the 
               floss.  He keeps pulling out floss.

               More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally, 
               the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin ties it off high on the 
               pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his 
               hand like a surgeon&amp;emdash;

               Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile 
               the guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the 
               open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES 
               at the guard loudly.  He turns around.

               Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing 
               both ends.

               She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety 
               right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water.  
               Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared 
               all over his face.

               He and Austin STRUGGLE.

               The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's 
               head dangling over the water.  SEA

               BASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's
