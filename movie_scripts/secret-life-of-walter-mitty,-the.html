          Walter Mitty (30s) sits at his small kitchen table, balancing
          his check book. We see his last several expense entries:

          During the morning rush hour, a crowd of businessmen waits on
          the corner to cross the street. Walter is among them, dressed
          in a short-sleeve business shirt and tie and with a briefcase
          on hand. Nothing happens. Then Walter's head explodes.

          (ideas and images) of Walter's head; they've begun to float
          toward the ground.

          Some office work is going on. Then past the window (outside)

          The cafeteria is a large white room, with massive black and
          white Life photographs serving essentially as wallpaper.
          Particularly, they are images of physical and human immensity
          (photographs of the summitting of K2 and the beachheads of
          Normandy) and make the office workers here (Life magazine's
          low-level corporate workers among whom Walter is one) seem
          tiny in terms of their personal accomplishments but also
          physically. Walter and a co-worker TIM NAUGHTON sit in front
          of the Massive K2 mountain summit photograph.

          Ted begins to clap (for some reason). So the gathered
          employees also begin some watered-down clapping. Walter is
          among them, standing beside his mom, who is clapping too.
          Then they all stop the fake good cheer and head back to work.

          robes and headdresses. It's a lot to take in. Walter seems

          hostel. Late teens and kids in their early twenties mill
          about the lobby. Walter's the oldest guy around. The clerk
          has been speaking to Soren in Arabic. Soren seems to know
          him. They seem to have been talking about Walter. Then they
          stop. Then Soren turns to Walter.  note - Walter has a
          skateboard with him now (with Arabic graphics on it); he'll
          have it with him for a while.

          Walter's on the bus. He's looking at the out of focus print

          Some time passes. Then Walter puts on his loupes (eye glasses
          with a center magnifying lens). Then his cell phone vibrates.
          He's got an email. He reads it.

           it looks weird because we're seeing it through Walter's
          magnifying loupes - but much of it is clear: It's from human
          resources and reads in part: because you have been terminated
          with cause you do not qualify for severance or to salary

          Walter's among some others, walking up a sidewalk home, but
          he's been so thrown by being fired in this manner that he's
          forgotten to take his head-mounted loupes off. It's an
          unusual image.
                         
          This is a view through Walter's loupes as he walks through
          Brooklyn trying to get his head together. The middle images
          are magnified but the outside circumference isn't - it's
          unusual and sort of pretty - to see people pass by, sometimes
          enhanced, then not, all a little dizzy, like Walter's
          feeling.

<b>          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Walter walks into his apartment. He sits down in the small
          living room (he's still wearing the loupes). Some time
          passes. Nothing seems to happen. Then, slowly, after
          considerable time, a look of powerful and complete
          astonishment comes over him. He's looking at something that
          has just shifted his world.
                         
          We see things from Walter's perspective (through the loupes).
          Most everything is out of focus because he's wearing them.
          But he's looking, in real life (in his apartment), at exactly
          the out of focus image that he has been carrying around a
          photo of. The object is in his apartment. He looks at this
          out of focus (because of the loupes) real object. Then he
          looks at the photo he still holds. They are indisputably the
          same. Then he looks back at the real object and removes his
          loupes to bring it into focus. It's the piano.

          walking west - all we see that way is snow, mountains and

          The G8 summit attendees (business leaders and government

          hustled past the crowds of chanting young people. Some are

          cups of ice and water. Then there's face to face, cop-

          Walter's alone in the back of the police wagon. His arms are
          shackled. He's sitting on the built in metal bench, until the
          transporter hits a bump and he falls to the metal floor. It's
          not easy to stand when your hands are cuffed. But Walter
          struggles up. But he's standing without any means to
          stabilize himself and every time the wagon turns he gets
          chucked around.

          She's typed additional stuff. Then she roots around in a
          check stash. Then she hands Walter an envelope. He takes it.
          He looks at it for a while. For the first time in a long
          while, he seems relieved.

          Walter's just walking through the park. He looks at peace.
          There are many others around, all coming and going at a
          normal pace, but the earth around them transforms from winter
          to summer smoothly over the course of thirty seconds as they
          naturally inhabit the park in their regular ways. So when
          Walter sits at a bench. It's all midsummer around him. He's
          smiling from relief.

          There's a winch machine, a huge rig, lifting this piano to
          the 7th floor of the residential building Walter secured for
          his mom. Walter and Odessa stand in Battery Park, looking up
          at the piano. The movers are setting it into the removed
          window space. It looks like it's going to fit.

          The piano has fit easily here. Odessa and Edna are
          straightening up, putting the last few things away. The
          room's in good shape. It's really pretty nice. Edna seems at
          home.

          They go. The room is quiet. Walter looks around again. Making
          it happen took considerable effort no one but Walter will
          know about. After a moment, he goes and sits at the piano.
          Some time passes. Then Walter plays the beginning of Cheers.
          Then he gets up and follows his sister and mom out.

          Walter's walking with Odessa and Edna. They've come past a
          newsstand with magazine displays. Walter was going to walk
          right on by like Edna and Odessa did. But he's noticed
          something on the magazine racks that's stopped him. He stands
          there for a while looking at it.
                         
          It's the last issue of Life Magazine. Its cover is a black
          and white photograph of Walter siting on a cement bench out
          front of the Time-Life building. He's got his lunch in a
          brown bag beside him; he's looking over photo prints with his
          loupe, working carefully on some day in the past to fulfill
          the wishes of Life's photographers- a person who's work the
          world never knew took place. It's really good. You can see
          the word LIFE on the building sign above the bench. So the
          last photograph, on the last cover of Life, elegantly honors
          the people who quietly worked there and cared for it.
                         
          Walter stands in front of the newsstand looking at it. It's
          the first time he's seeing it. It's a message that to Sean,
          at least, and possibly to others his work was meaningful.
