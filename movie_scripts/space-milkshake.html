</b>     A glowing blue box like a large toaster (the Time Cube) sits
     in a sterile lab shelf, plugged in. A rubber duck sits on a
     cluttered desk. GARY PINBACK (40) identified by "Gary"
     stitched on a white lab coat - enters frame, unplugs the box
     and shoves it in a duffle bag nervously (his face framed out
     of this entire montage). An ALARM SOUNDS. RED SIREN LIGHT
     splashes into frame. Opening credits play on walls and other
     surfaces of this montage before and after Gary runs through
     frames.
     Gary goes to a desk and rushes to steal stationary, staplers,
     pencils, a calculator etc; he sweeps the desk surface junk
     with his arm into the duffle bag on top of the Time Cube. He
     picks up the rubber duck and shoves it in his pocket.

     away. Gary's feet running. Duffle bag in frame.
     HIGH ANGLE: long hall, following Gary running.
     ANGLE ON DOOR: it's marked SPACEPORT LEVEL 4, Gary slams into
     it and runs through.
     LOW ANGLE: Gary runs through long high ceiling hall away from
     camera. Red Siren light spins on the wall. Gary goes through
     the far door.
     Gary slips and wipes out, spilling his stationary. He grabs
     his time cube bag and duck and keeps running.

     The light turns green and the inner door opens, Jimmy enters
     the space station airlock module.
     A sign above the airlock says: "REMEMBER ALL ACCIDENTS IN
     SPACE ARE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS". Jimmy sneezes again, wipes his
     nose, offers his hand to shake. He reads Anton's name tag.

      Jimmy finds a way around a large machine just as Tilda2 zips
      up her jumpsuit, facing away. She has strange geometric lines
      like tatoos on her back. He's struck by her picturesque

     Jimmy turns and starts to head out, bumping into Tilda2 with

          you the pickled onion and cheese.

Tilda knocks little containers around searching the
cupboards. She carelessly knocks things off the shelf.

A FLASH outside the window. Tilda turns, very scared, and
looks out the window. Jimmy goes to the window next to her.

     SMASH! The sound of an impact, like a car accident. The room
     trembles. METAL CREAKING NOISES. Things jiggle and fall off
     the shelves. Tilda stares at Jimmy, scared.
     Val and Anton are bracing themselves for more. The shaking
     stops.

     Jimmy's computer screen shows the exterior of the space
     station - a DENTED PANEL with something yellow stuck in it.
     The screen is too fuzzy to tell what it is. Anton looks over
     Jimmy's shoulder.

      SOUND. The inner airlock hatch opens.
      Valentina helps Anton off with his helmet. In his gloved hand
      is a slightly burned rubber duckie. Anton takes off his suit

      The room shakes more. Tilda unplugs the RS232 cable from the
      wall and grabs a cable cutter from Jimmy's belt. She pulls
      down her jumpsuit shoulder exposing her back tattoo lines
      again. Jimmy watches in fascination.
      Tilda jabs herself and cuts a 6 inch hole in her abdomen.
      There's no blood. She reaches in and feels around.

Tilda grunts and grimaces - something rips and her hand comes
out with an organic/electric device with blinking lights.
Wires and cables poke out of the hole in her stomach and drip
with goo, she tucks them back in painfully with one hand and
holds herself closed as she hands the device to Jimmy.

Jimmy ducks back under   the panel and stuffs the strange
device into the socket   of the circuit board. Sparks fly and
lights start blinking!   The SOUND of the midrange data
processor humming back   to life. Green lights on monitors.
Jimmy clamps alligator clips around a broken cable and
scrambles up. The monitor screens show green blinking
symbols. Tilda uses a staple gun to close her wound, showing
no sign of pain, tucks away her RS232 cable and zips up.
<b>                       JIMMY (CONT'D)

      The digital vector diagram monitor shows their orbit falling
      into the `danger zone' past the `Kármán line'. Jimmy sees
      Tilda suffer.

      Gary and Val turn toward the hallway: Tilda's there. She
      throws the laser blaster to Valentina who catches it and aims
      at Gary. Gary freezes, afraid.
      Valentina takes great pleasure at pulling the trigger.
      ZZZZORCH! A beam blasts from the blaster at Gary, instantly
      causing an immense SPLAT!
      Valentina opens her eyes to see it rain Gary bits.
      Anton comes over.

      Jimmy hits the big red button! A BLAST OF PLASMA fires out of
      the thruster next to him.
      (Wide shot) Over the course of five long seconds, the station
