<b>   IN BLACK --
</b>
   We hear the feral, primeval sounds of a jungle at night. A
   timpani bangs an ominous beat.

<b>   FADE IN ON:
</b>

<b>   A JUNGLE - NIGHT
</b>
   A BUNNY nervously walks through the dark, foreboding forest,
   frightened by every shadow and moving leaf.

</b>          Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust!
          Thousands of years ago, these were
          the forces that ruled our world. A
          world where prey were scared of
          predators. And predators had an
          uncontrollable biological urge to
          maim and maul and...

   The timpani crescendos. A JAGUAR leaps out of the shadows,
   attacks the bunny, who screams--

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>

<b>   INSIDE A BARN - A JUNGLE (SET) - NIGHT
</b>
   The action continues-- as imagined by an amateur stage
   production.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY
</b>          Blood, blood, blood!

   Reams of red papier mâché entrails ooze from the bunny. And
   when those run out-- projectile ketchup.

   Reveal: These are ANIMAL KID ACTORS. The bunny, JUDY HOPPS,
   10, is our hero. And this is her play being staged. A banner
   reads: CARROT DAYS TALENT SHOW!

<b>                       YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
</b>          And death.

   The CROWD looks on, confused. The music goes discordant as
   BOBBY CATMULL, a bobcat, bangs a drum.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
</b>          Back then, the world was divided in
          two. Vicious predator or Meek prey.
<b>                                                           2.
</b>

TWO BOXES drop down, labeled VICIOUS PREDATOR and MEEK PREY.
The PREDATOR box lands on the jaguar. The MEEK PREY box lands
on Judy. Her entrails get stuck outside the box. She drags
them underneath with her.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          But over time, we evolved, and
          moved beyond our primitive savage
          ways.

A YOUNG SHEEP wearing a white muumuu and a cardboard rainbow
on his head does an improvisational dance across the stage.
Judy and the jaguar burst out of their boxes, now wearing
white muumuus, too.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
</b>          Now, predator and prey live in
          harmony.

Judy and the jaguar shake hands as the sheep throws glitter.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
</b>          And every young mammal has
          multitudinous opportunities.

<b>                    ASTRONAUT SHEEP
</b>          Yeah, I don't have to cower in a
          herd anymore.

The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. She's wearing a homemade
astronaut costume.

<b>                    ASTRONAUT SHEEP (CONT'D)
</b>          Instead I can be an astronaut.

Catmull plays a slide whistle.

<b>                    ACTUARY JAGUAR
</b>          I don't have to be a lonely hunter
          any more.

The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. He's dressed in a suit.

<b>                    ACTUARY
</b>          Today I can hunt for tax
          exemptions. I'm gonna be an
          actuary!

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY
</b>          And I can make the world a better
          place! I am going to be...

Catmull plays a 70s-style cop show theme on the boom box.
Judy rips off her muumuu, revealing a POLICE OFFICER UNIFORM.
<b>                                                         3.
</b>

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
</b>          A police officer!

Judy's parents, BONNIE &amp; STU, look stunned. A mean fox kid,
GIDEON GREY, snickers. He's sitting next to a WEASEL KID.

<b>                    GIDEON GREY
</b>          Bunny cop. That is the most
          stupidest thing I ever heard.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY
</b>          It may seem impossible to small
          minds--
              (points at Gideon)
          I'm looking at you Gideon Grey.

Catmull drops down a backdrop showing a bright city skyline.
He hits play on an uplifting song.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
</b>          But just 211 miles away stands the
          great city of Zootopia! Where our
          ancestors first joined together in
          peace, and declared that anyone can
          be anything! Thank you and good
          night!

Judy gives a mighty thespian bow, to the sound of Catmull on
organ. The audience applauds. Judy's parents look concerned.


<b>EXT. CARROT DAYS FESTIVAL - LATER THAT DAY
</b>
A festival replete with food booths, games and rides-- all
aggressively carrot-themed. Judy, in her Cop Costume, bounces
along with her folks. We catch their conversation mid-stream.

<b>                    STU HOPPS
</b>          Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
          and me got to be so darn happy?

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY
</b>          Nope.

<b>                    STU HOPPS
</b>          Well, we gave up on our dreams and
          we settled, right Bon?

<b>                    BONNIE HOPPS
</b>          Oh yes, that's right, Stu. We
          settled hard.
<b>                                                         4.
</b>

<b>                    STU HOPPS
</b>          See, that's the beauty of
          complacency, Jude. If you don't try
          anything new, you'll never fail.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY
</b>          I like trying, actually.

<b>                    BONNIE HOPPS
</b>          What your father means, hon, is
          it's gonna be difficult--
          impossible even-- for you to become
          a police officer.

<b>                    STU HOPPS
</b>          Right. There's never been a bunny
          cop.

<b>                    BONNIE HOPPS
</b>          No.

<b>                    STU HOPPS
</b>          Bunnies don't do that.

<b>                    BONNIE HOPPS
</b>          Never.

<b>                    STU HOPPS
</b>          Never.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY
</b>          Oh. Then I guess I'll have to be
          the first one. Because I am gonna
          make the world...
              (parkours against a
               vendor's stand)
          A better place!

<b>                    STU HOPPS
</b>          OR... um, heck, you wanna talk
          about making the world a better
          place--

The trio arrives at the Hopps Family Farm carrot booth, which
is manned by too many children to count.

<b>                    STU HOPPS (CONT'D)
</b>          --no better way to do it than
          becoming a carrot farmer.

<b>                    BONNIE HOPPS
</b>          Yes! Your dad, me, your 275
          brothers and sisters-- we're
          changing the world.
<b>                                                         5.
</b>

<b>                    STU HOPPS
</b>          Yep.

<b>                    BONNIE HOPPS
</b>          One carrot at a time...

<b>                    STU HOPPS
</b>          Amen to that. Carrot farming is a
          noble profession.

Judy spots GIDEON GREY stalking some SMALL ANIMALS. She
remains fixed on Gideon as Stu and Bonnie yap on obliviously.

<b>                    BONNIE HOPPS (O.S.)
</b>          Mmm hmm. Just putting the seeds in
          the ground.

<b>                    STU HOPPS (O.S.)
</b>          Ahh, at one with the soil.

We're back on Bonnie and Stu's conversation now.

<b>                    BONNIE HOPPS
</b>          You get it. I mean, it's great to
          have dreams.

<b>                    STU HOPPS
</b>          Yeah, just as long as you don't
          believe in em too much.
              (finally noticing Judy's
               absence)
          Where in the heck'd she go?

ACROSS THE FAIR... From behind a tree, Judy watches as Gideon
Grey intimidates the astronaut sheep, SHARLA.

<b>                    GIDEON GREY
</b>          Gimme your tickets right now, or
          I'm gonna kick your meek little
          sheep butt.

<b>                    SHARLA
</b>          Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!

<b>                    GIDEON GREY
</b>          Baa-baa. What're ya gonna do, cry?

Gideon swipes Sharla's fair tickets.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY (O.S.)
</b>          Hey!

Judy charges toward the danger.
<b>                                                         6.
</b>

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
</b>          You heard her. Cut it out.

Gideon turns. There's Judy, projecting the image of a tiny
Clint Eastwood.

<b>                    GIDEON GREY
</b>          Nice costume, loser. What crazy
          world are you living in where you
          think a bunny could be a cop?

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY
</b>          Kindly return my friends' tickets.

Gideon pats the tickets in his pocket.

<b>                    GIDEON GREY
</b>          Come and get `em.... But watch out,
          `cause I'm a fox-- and like you
          said in your dumb little stage
          play, us predators used to eat
          prey. And that killer instinct's
          still in our Dunnahh.

<b>                    TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID
</b>              (sotto, to Gideon)
          Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's
          pronounced D-N-A.

<b>                    GIDEON GREY
</b>          Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY
</b>          You don't scare me, Gideon.

Gideon shoves Judy. Hard. She falls. The other prey animals
flee to safety behind a nearby tree, leaving her to face the
thugs alone.

<b>                    GIDEON GREY
</b>          You scared now?

Judy starts to tear up. Her nose starts to twitch.

<b>                    TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID
</b>          Lookit her nose twitch. She is
          scared!

<b>                    GIDEON GREY
</b>          Cry little baby bunny. Cry, cry --

Suddenly-- BAM! Judy kicks Gideon in the face with her hind
legs. He stumbles back, then checks his lip for blood.
<b>                                                          7.

<b>                    GIDEON GREY (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh, you don't know when to quit, do
          ya?

He unsheathes his claws like a switchblade, then slaps her,
drawing blood from her cheek. She cowers, as do her scared
friends behind the tree.

<b>                    GIDEON GREY (CONT'D)
</b>          I want you to remember this moment--
          the next time you think you will
          ever be anything more than just a
          stupid, carrot farming dumb bunny.

Gideon and his pal head off, laughing and high-fiving. The
prey animals run back over to Judy, who wipes the blood from
her cheek. She fights tears, defeated.

<b>                    GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY
</b>          That looks bad.

<b>                    SHARLA
</b>          Are you okay, Judy?

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY
</b>          Yeah... Yeah, I'm okay.

Judy smiles and then whips out the tickets as she gets up.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
</b>          Here you go.

<b>                    SHARLA
</b>          Wow! You got our tickets!

<b>                    GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY

<b>                    SHARLA
</b>          Yeah! That Gideon Grey doesn't know
          what he's talkin' `bout.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY
</b>          Well, he was right about one
          thing...

Judy picks up the cop hat, puts it on her head.

<b>                    YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
</b>          I don't know when to quit.

Hopps and the comparatively huge CADETS sit in a circle as
MAJOR FRIEDKIN, an intimidating drill instructor, lectures.

<b>                    MAJOR FRIEDKIN
</b>          Listen up Cadets! Zootopia has 12

<b>TUNDRA TOWN ICE WALL:

Judy and the cadets sprint toward the wall. The CLAWED

<b>IN THE TOILET:

Hopps ruses into a stall. The toilet is considerably larger

toilet. In the next stall, we see the feet of a Hippo.

Then, KERSPLASH! Hopps falls into the toilet.

Hopps bounds up the wall, jumps off of the backs of the big

Hopps dodges a few swings. The Bison misses. Hopps bounds
over him and uses his momentum-- kicking his other hand into
his face, knocking him down.

</b>          When I was 9. Gideon Grey was a

Stu begins pulling a bunch of PINK FOX DETERRENTS from a bag.

<b>                    STU HOPPS
</b>          This is fox deterrent.

<b>                    STU HOPPS
</b>          Check this out!

Stu removes a Fox Taser, fires it up. It sizzles.

<b>                    BONNIE HOPPS
</b>          Oh for goodness sake. She has no
          need for a fox taser, Stu.

<b>                    STU HOPPS

pulls up.

Judy heads for the train, head held high. No turning back.

Stu and Bonnie watch, both holding back tears. Suddenly, the
emotion catches up with Judy. She turns, runs back to her
parents, hugs them tight.

<b>                    JUDY (CONT'D)
</b>          I love you guys.

One more squeeze, then Judy runs off and jumps on the train.

As the train pulls away, her family runs next to it, waving.

</b>          Bye!

Judy looks back as their faces recede into the distance. The
train blasts past Bunnyburrow, passing its exponentially
increasing population sign.

Judy pulls out her iPhone and clicks play... her new life is
about to begin and we

As Hopps takes the train, it rounds a curve. She looks up.
Her eyes light up. There in the distance is...


<b>EXT. ZOOTOPIA CITY - ESTABLISHING

Hopps emerges into the main Zootopia central plaza. It's an
amazing, magnificent place.

A JUMBOTRON featuring a gazelle pop star, GAZELLE, blares its
message in a loop.

On the bedside table sits the PINK FOX REPELLENT. Judy

walks out of frame. HOLD on the table. One second. Then
Judy's hand comes back into frame and grabs the Repellent.

Hopps dons a vest, buckles her seat belt, floors the pedal
and... takes off at 2 miles an hour. Which leads to a

<b>PARKING METER MONTAGE --
</b>
Hopps zooms past a row of cars, marking their tires. Cruising
the streets, her super-sensitive ears hear a meter ding. She
slams her brakes-- then proudly issues Ticket #1.

Ding! Another meter goes off. Then another. And another.
She's on a roll. She looks down at her counter. It's at 200.

<b>                    HOPPS

meter. Hopps rolls her eyes and writes herself a ticket.

As Hopps puts the ticket on her windshield, she hears a voice
across the street:

<b>                    TRUCK DRIVER (O.S.)
</b>          Hey, watch where you're going, Fox!

Hopps looks across the street to see... a RED FOX. Hopps
looks at him, a little suspicious.

The Fox looks around, then slinks into a café. Hopps runs
across the street and peeks in the window. It's an ice cream
parlor, but... the FOX IS GONE.

Elephants scoop ice cream with their trunks, suck up nuts
with their trunks. It's cute but also disgusting. As Hopps
enters, she spots the fox, NICK WILDE, at the front of the
line and overhears the proprietor, JERRY, addressing him.

Another meter dings, Hopps puts another ticket on a very

Hopps repeatedly bangs her head on the steering wheel.

Hopps jumps out and gives chase-- ditching her silly vest.

</b>          I got dibs! Officer Hopps, I am in
          pursuit!

Hopps chases the Weasel, who races through Savannah Central.
As Hopps advances, the Weasel ducks into... LITTLE RODENTIA.
Thanks to her small size, Hopps follows him in.

<b>                    HOPPS(CONT'D)
</b>          You! Freeze!

<b>                     MCHORN

Hopps emerges in Little Rodentia, teeming with tiny rodents.

<b>                    HOPPS
</b>          Stop!

Hopps spots the Weasel, who's using two mouse cars as skates.
She chases after him, smashing through Little Rodentia. As
the Weasel jumps off the top of a mouse building, he knocks
it over, but Hopps is able to save them from crashing.

Resuming the chase, Hopps jumps off the building-- landing
precariously in the midst of a large group of mice.

Hopps locates Weaselton, who's safely making his escape on
the top of a tiny mouse train.

<b>                    DUKE WEASELTON
</b>          Bon voyage, flat foot!

But Hopps won't quit. She takes a short cut and knocks him
off the train. Rodents scream and run amidst the chaos.

<b>                    HOPPS
</b>          Hey! Stop right there!

The Weasel throws an ornamental donut at Hopps.

<b>                    DUKE WEASELTON
</b>          Have a donut, coppah!

But the donut misses and rolls towards some SHREWS coming out
of "Mousies."

</b>          Ohmygawd, did you see those leopard

              (sees the donut about to
               kill her)
          Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!

But at the last second... Hopps stops it! Deep breath...

<b>                    HOPPS
</b>          I love your hair.

<b>                    FRU FRU SHREW
</b>          Aw... thank you.

Meanwhile, the Weasel spots the bag he was stealing and
smugly picks it up, ready to leave.

<b>                    DUKE WEASELTON
</b>          Come to papa...

Then out of nowhere, Hopps dumps the donut on his head.

door and hits Clawhauser's desk. It settles, revealing Hopps.

Clawhauser places the Otterton file on his desk for Hopps.

<b>                    CLAWHAUSER

Hopps opens the file. It's a single piece of paper. What?

          file I've ever seen! Leads: none,
          witnesses: none-- and you're not in
          the computer system yet, so
          resources: none.
              (chuckles)
          I hope you didn't stake your career
          on cracking this one.

Clawhauser takes a bite of his donut and the crumbs land on a
picture in the file, drawing Hopps's attention to it.

</b>          Okay.
              (deep breath)
          "Last known sighting..."

Hopps brushes away the crumbs, revealing a picture of Mr.
Otterton on the street. Clawhauser annoyingly slurps from a
soda bottle. Hopps squints at the picture, intrigued.

<b>                     HOPPS (CONT'D)

Hopps uses Clawhauser's bottle to enlarge the picture. She
sees Mr. Otterton holding a PAWPSICLE.

The Mystic Spring Oasis is new agey, full of incense, etc. A

pick up a clump of fur.

YOUNG NICK, tiny and cherubic, looks in the mirror. We see
MOTHER's paws tying the scout kerchief around his neck.

<b>                    NICK (V.O.)
</b>          ...so, my mom scraped together
          enough money to buy me a brand new

<b>INT. SCOUT MEETING - MOMENTS LATER (FLASHBACK)
</b>
Young Nick enters a church basement, spots a GROUP OF PREY
KIDS, all in scout uniforms. They wave him over.

<b>                    NICK (V.O.)(CONT'D)
</b>          ...the only fox.

They high five Nick. It looks promising and fun.

<b>                    NICK (V.O.)
</b>          I was so proud.

Suddenly, a BIG KID turns off the lights. Other KIDS switch
on FLASHLIGHTS, shining them on Nick like gestapo spotlights.

<b>                    MEAN KID ANIMAL
</b>          Okay. Now raise your right hand and
          deliver the oath.

</b>          What?

Then, a bunch of KID ANIMALS tackle Nick. Soon, all of the
animals pile on, kicking and shoving him.

<b>                    YOUNG NICK (CONT'D)
</b>          No! What did I do wrong, you guys?!
          No! Please tell me, what did I do
          wrong?!

With Nick pinned, the primary mean kid straddles him. Someone
hands him a MUZZLE. The mean kid snaps it on Nick's snout.

<b>                    MEAN KID ANIMAL
</b>          If you thought we would ever trust
          a fox without a muzzle, you're even
          dumber than you look.

Nick breaks free from the kids. Scrambles away from them in
fright. As they laugh, he races out the door.

<b>                    MEAN KID ANIMAL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Aw, is he gonna cry?

Once out sight, Nick panics as he struggles to remove the
muzzle. It won't come off. Finally-- painfully-- he pulls it
off and throws it to the ground. He collapses, weeping.

Nick. He abruptly changes the subject.

the door shuts on her, spilling the binders to the floor.

          Tujunga, Tujunga... we're in.

Nick and Hopps watch the footage from the night before. We
can see the jaguar going nuts. Then a BLACK VAN skids up, and
some WOLVES hop out.

disappear through a tunnel and don't come out the other side.

emerge in the van.

alleys and back roads.

spy from a hundred yards away.

Nick and Hopps sneak up to the guard gate, where TWO WOLVES
are stationed.

Using elaborate hand signals, Nick motions he's going to
sneak past first. He gets around the gate, but as he gets
close... a wolf sniffs the air... he's onto him.

Nick reaches around and grabs a piece of wood to use as a
weapon. The wolf moves toward Nick... but before he reaches
him... Ooooooooooo!

A distant howl grabs his attention. It's Hopps, cupping her
mouth to make the howl sound distant. The wolf hears it and
can't help but howl as well. Another guard approaches.

<b>                    WOLF GUARD

More wolves start to howl. Nick looks at Hopps, impressed.

<b>                     HOPPS

Nick and Hopps use the distraction to jump the fence and
sneak into the complex.

<b>                    NICK
</b>          You are a clever bunny.

Above, they notice a drainage pipe leading into the building.


<b>INT. CLIFFSIDE ASYLUM - LARGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Nick and Hopps emerge from the drain pipe into the creepy
asylum. They're in a large, cavernous room, full of old
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. It's like a combination of an old hospital
and a turn-of-the-century zoo.

<b>                    HOPPS
</b>          It looks like this was a hospital.

Judy shines her light down a corridor, at the end of which is
a metal door with a blue light shining within. Nick nears the
door, about to open it... the tension builds and then...

RAAGH! A SAVAGE TIGER emerges behind the glass of a nearby
cage, startling Nick and sending him running to Hopps.

Hopps swivels her flashlight to reveal: dozens of reflective
eyes. Nick and Hopps make their way down a long corridor of
cages, looking for the jaguar.

<b>                    HOPPS

He's still feral, on all fours and pacing in a cell. They

in the last cage: a FERAL OTTER. It's EMMITT OTTERTON.

The Wolves storm in, searching for the intruders... and see
the swirling water of a toilet disappearing down the drain.

Hopps and Nick fly through the water slide like tubes of the
sewer system, cascading over a waterfall. Both scream. They
land in the river below. Nick pop up first. He looks
desperately for Judy.

</b>          A caribou is in critical condition,
          the victim of a mauling by a savage
          polar bear. This-- the 27th such
          attack-- comes just one week after
          ZPD Officer Judy Hopps connected
          the violence to traditionally
          predatory animals.

<b>                    DUKE WEASELTON (PRE-LAP)
</b>          A ram named Doug. We got a drop

Nick and Hopps approach an abandoned subway station.

They arrive at the entrance and quickly sneak under the gate.


<b>INT. ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION - MOMENTS LATER

They emerge on a platform and spot an abandoned subway car.

As they sneak up to it... Hopps pulls open the window and
looks inside the car. They both jump into...


<b>INT. THE GREENHOUSE CAR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
They both see the rows of night howlers.

<b>                    HOPPS
</b>          The weasel wasn't lying.

<b>                     NICK

          howlers...

Click! A door opens off screen! They quickly hide under a
desk as a TOUGH SHEEP LABWORKER enters.

He goes through the process of harvesting the pollen,
eventually producing a small, blue paint ball pellet of night
howler toxin. Nick and Hopps watch it all.

The Sheep's phone RINGS.

<b>                    DOUG

          You got Doug here. What's the mark?
          Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

The Sheep loads a gun, cocks it. We see a MAP with pictures
of a various animal targets.

          I can hit him. Listen, I hit a tiny
          little otter through the open
          window of a moving car.

Hearing this, the pieces of the puzzle start falling into
place for Hopps. She looks up at the picture of Otterton-- we
FLASHBACK to see Doug hitting him with a serum pellet. Then
Hopps looks at Manchas's picture-- we FLASHBACK to that.

          Out.

Hopps looks around, what is she going to do. As Doug goes to
the door to unlock it, Hopps creeps out of their hiding spot.

other two Thugs. Hopps locks the door.

Hopps rushes to the control room, tries to start the engine.

Nick and Hopps race away, feeling fairly confident.

<b>                    NICK

<b>                    NICK
</b>          Well, I can cross that off the
          bucket list.

Things are looking up, when:

BAM! Woolter just busted into the car. Nick slams the door
closed right before Woolter gets to them.

<b>                     NICK (CONT'D)
</b>          I may have to rescind that victory

Noise from the roof above them... BAM! BAM! BAM!

<b>                    NICK (CONT'D)
</b>          Maybe that's just hail?

Uh-oh. Jesse busts through the window. He's stuck, but
flailing at Hopps. Nick tries to pull him away.

<b>                      NICK (CONT'D)
</b>          Back off!

Nick gets punched backward and notices Woolter charging
toward the door at full speed. Right before Woolter arrives,
Nick pulls the door open.

<b>                      NICK (CONT'D)
</b>          Incoming!

Woolter's momentum carries him into Jesse-- dislodging him
onto the tracks. Hopps is knocked out the window, but grabs
onto Woolter's horn. Hopps tries to hang on as the subway car
hurtles down the tunnel.

<b>                      NICK (CONT'D)

          No! No! Please stop!

<b>                    HOPPS
</b>          Do not stop this car!

Jesse dives to safety and Hopps gets bucked up onto the top
of the train. Nick takes the wheel as the train emerges above
ground. Hopps looks up to see... Another train coming toward
them... on the same track! She sees a turn-off switch ahead.

<b>                    HOPPS (CONT'D)
</b>          Speed up, Nick! Speed up!

<b>                    NICK

          There's another train coming!

<b>                    HOPPS
</b>          Trust me! SPEED! UP!

Woolter sees the train coming and tries to get unstuck, but
he can't. He struggles like crazy.
<b>                                                        100.

<b>                      WOOLTER

Then, at the last second, Hopps appears next to him:

<b>                      HOPPS
</b>            Hey. Need some help?

Hopps kicks Woolter off the train and he lands perfectly on
the turn-off switch on the tracks below. At the last possible
second, their train switches tracks-- just avoiding the
oncoming car.

Except...

<b>                      NICK
</b>            Oh no! Oh no, no, no! Too fast!
            Hold on!

The train derails as it takes the curve. The night howlers
catch fire.

<b>                      NICK (CONT'D)
</b>            I think this is our stop!

Hopps and Nick dive out of the car and onto a subway
platform... Just as the lab car EXPLODES.

<b>                      HOPPS
</b>            Okay... Maybe some of the evidence

Nick holds up a case-- containing a gun and a pellet.

Hopps turns toward the ZPD. Uh oh. One of Bellwether's RAMS
is blocking the way. Nick just now gets what's going on.

Hopps looks over her shoulder as she runs-- not seeing a
sharp WOOLY MAMMOTH TUSK sticking out. It slashes her leg,
knocking her off her feet.

He carries her behind a pillar.

Nick digs a handkerchief from his pocket. A few BLUEBERRIES
fall out with it.

Bellwether finally appears, flanked by the Rams.

<b>WITH BELLWETHER &amp; THUGS --

Bellwether talks as they look for Hopps and Nick...

RAMS-- there they are.

Hopps and Nick are making a run for it. They're going to make
it to the ZPD! When suddenly...

BAM! A RAM tackles them both, knocking the case out of Nick's
paws. Both of them fall into a sunken diorama. Bellwether,
with case in hand, looks over the edge.

<b>                    BELLWETHER (CONT'D)

Bellwether takes the dart gun out of the case, aims at Nick
and... THWICK! She darts him.

<b>                       HOPPS

<b>                    BELLWETHER
</b>          Yes, police! There's a savage fox
          in the natural history museum.
          Officer Hopps is down! Please
          hurry!

Nick is starting to turn.

<b>                    HOPPS
</b>          No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.

<b>                    BELLWETHER
</b>          Oh, but he can't help it, can he?
          Since preds are just biologically
          predisposed to be savages.

Nick stalks Hopps, who tries to limp away.

<b>                    BELLWETHER (CONT'D)
</b>          Gosh, think of the headline: "Hero
          Cop Killed By Savage Fox..."

<b>                    HOPPS

          and you stay in power?

<b>                    BELLWETHER
</b>          Yeah, pretty much.

          Oh, Nick! No!

<b>                    BELLWETHER
</b>          Bye-Bye, Bunny.

Nick lunges. He attacks. Hopps screams. Bellwether smiles.

<b>                    HOPPS
</b>          Blood, blood, blood! And death.

Bellwether looks confused. Nick stands up.

          Besides, I think we got it, I think
          we got it. We got it up there,

          all out beautifully.

<b>                    BELLWETHER

Bellwether looks at her gun, in disbelief.

<b>                    NICK
</b>          Yea, oh, are you looking for the
          serum?
              (holds it up)
          Well, it's right here.

<b>                    HOPPS
</b>          What you've got in the weapon there-
          - those are blueberries. From my
          family's farm.

Livid, Bellwether sees a blueberry in the gun's chamber.

<b>                    NICK
</b>          They are delicious.
              (licking fingers)
          You should try some.

Hopps holds up the carrot pen.

          It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
          Boom.

Bogo and a TEAM OF COPS burst onto the scene. Bellwether
looks to run but there's nowhere to go. She's nailed.

A PREDATOR-PREY news team reads the headlines. FOOTAGE shows

          behind bars today, guilty of
          masterminding the savage attacks

          denies any knowledge of her plot,
          claiming he was just trying to
          protect the city.

A FELINE REPORTER, KITTY COWLICK, interviews Lionheart.

<b>                    LIONHEART
</b>          Did I falsely imprison those
          animals? Well, yes. Yes I did. It
          was a classic "doing the wrong

          a deal.

Mr. Otterton, who wakes up into the arms of his wife.

She hugs him and he holds her tight. We pull back to reveal
Hopps in the room, watching their reunion.

<b>EXT. ZOOTOPIA CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY
</b>
Hopps walks through the CENTRAL PLAZA of ZOOTOPIA. She looks
around to see animals coming back together. She focuses on
two KIDS: one pred, one prey playing soccer.

<b>                    HOPPS (V.O.)
</b>          When I was a kid, I thought
          Zootopia was this perfect place
          where everyone got along and anyone
          could be anything...

Hopps kicks the soccer ball with the kids.

<b>                    HOPPS (V.O.)
</b>          Turns out, real life's a little bit
          more complicated than a slogan on a
          bumper sticker. Real life is messy.

AT THE ZPD: Hopps enters to find Clawhauser back at his desk,
unpacking. What's more-- TWO COPS approach him with donuts.

<b>                    HOPPS (V.O.)
</b>          We all have limitations. We all
          make mistakes. Which means-- hey,
          glass half full!-- we all have a
          lot in common. And the more we try
          to understand one another, the more
          exceptional each of us will be. But
          we have to try.


<b>EXT. CADET TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

Reveal: Hopps is giving a commencement address to the
GRADUATES of the Police Academy.

<b>                    HOPPS
</b>          So, no matter what type of animal

          to our first fox...

Reveal: Nick is a cadet. He removes his shades, winks at
Hopps.

<b>                    HOPPS (CONT'D)
</b>          I implore you... try. Try to make
          the world a better place.

On stage, Hopps readies to pin a BADGE on Nick. As she
approaches, they exchange a nod-- a small, sincere gesture.
She places the badge, then gives Nick an official salute.

Caps are thrown in the air. The music fades out, leaving just
the APPLAUSE, which is interrupted by:

jamming the Pawpsickle into his face.

They smile wide. They're stopped at a red light, when
suddenly-- a TRICKED OUT RED SPORTS CAR blasts through the
light! They look at each other and smile even wider.

Hopps stomps on the gas. Nick hits the siren. The patrol car
takes off...


<b>EXT. STREETS OF ZOOTOPIA - MOMENTS LATER

The fleeing sports car comes to a screeching halt. ANGLE ON
the license plate: FST NML. Hopps and Nick exit their car and
approach the driver.
