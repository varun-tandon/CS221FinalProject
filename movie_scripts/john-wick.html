          A small, quaint, two-bedroom farmhouse: a classic. Nearby, a
          small barn -its paint chipped, wood worn- sits nestled within
          the setting. The homestead feels slightly abandoned, the
          facade -especially the roof- in dire need of an overhaul.

          The hour hand of an old, electric clock shifts slightly,
          marking six a.m. A soft alarm sounds. Beneath the blankets,
          a body shifts, a weathered hand reaching out to silence the
          antique.
                         
          A beat... a sigh... a groan... and JOHN WICK -early sixties,
          salt-and-pepper hair, three-day beard, former boxer, former
          military, tired, beaten down, and at wit's end- sits up,
          staring unblinkingly out at the day.
                         
          A beat... and he stands, donning a weathered robe and a pair
          of slippers. John stuffs his hands into his pockets...

          ...and shuffles down the corridor, the walls overflowing with
          family pictures, each badly in need of dusting. They
          catalogue a long and healthy life with his wife, Norma; the
          pictures presenting a time line of sorts. No children, yet
          sheer, unadulterated happiness.

          As John makes his way through his home, we can see that it is
          cluttered and unorganized. Dirty, in fact, as if it hasn't
          been cleaned in months.

          John opens the door, retrieves the newspaper, closes, and
          locks the door behind him, without giving the outside so much
          as a glance.

          John unceremoniously tosses the newspaper onto the table,
          opens a cupboard, and measures out a couple of tablespoons of
          Folgers Coffee into an old percolator.
                         
          As it begins to bubble, John open the fridge, studies its
          contents for a moment or two, and then closes it, abandoning
          the thought of breakfast.
                         
          He pours himself a cup of coffee and sits at the table. The
          newspaper is ignored. He drinks in silence for a long, dark,
          brooding moment, the loneliness almost unsettling.
                         
          Suddenly, the phone on the wall RINGS.
                         
          John lowers his cup, staring at the device, his eyes tired.
          A beat... and he stands, walking slowly to answer it.

          As he listens to the voice on the other end, John remains
          still... stoic.

          John hangs up the phone and returns to the table, sinking
          slowly down into his chair.
                         
          A long beat...
                         
          ...and John begins to weep, his hands trembling as he lowers
          his face in excruciating, utter, and complete sorrow.

          Having shaved and showered, wearing an old -but well-fitted-
          gray suit, John pushes open the garage door...
                         
          ...to reveal a legend in dire need of a total overhaul: a
          black, 1969 FORD MUSTANG `BOSS 429'.

          A smile plays at his lips as John walks into the garage,
          running a hand along the chassis, desperately in need of a
          wash and wax. Behind him, the wall is lined with tools: a
          mechanic's dream enclave.

          John takes a moment to breath it in: he loves this car...
          although he hasn't taken very good care of it as of late. A
          beat... and he slips the key into the ignition, twisting it,
          the motor coughing to life, the exhaust pipe belching black
          smoke.

          The vehicle pulls out of the garage, stalls briefly, come
          back to life, puttering on down the road.

          Carrying a humble bouquet of yellow daisies, John slowly
          makes his way down the eerily empty corridor. He pauses
          before a picture on the wall, glancing at his reflection upon
          the glass. He takes a deep breath, exhales, and enters a
          room.

          John slowly approaches the figure lying in bed: surrounded by
          machinery, accompanied by the soft sounds of technology.
                         
          He removes the wilted daisies from the vase, tosses them in
          the trash, and replaces them with fresh ones.
                         
          He pulls over a chair, reaches out, and takes Norma's hand:
          she is comatose, her breathing synthetic... so many
          machines... so many wires, tubes, and monitors.
                         
          We never see her face:   just her silhouette.
                         
          He holds her hand for a long moment in heavy silence.

          Behind him, the DOCTOR -of a similar age to John- enters,
          placing a hand on John's shoulder. John lowers his head, and
          nods. With a bit of effort, he stands, staring down at her
          for a long moment, never once releasing his grip, and leans
          over to kiss her on the forehead.

          The doctor turns off the machine; lights dim, the room
          settles into silence, and Norma's body grows still.

          And then, he snaps; his hands gnarled into first, roaring
          with rage as he punches the pictures, ripping them from the
          wall, tossing them aside, eventually collapsing into a heap,
          out of breath, his knuckles bleeding.
                         
          A long beat... and he chuckles softly, pulling himself to his
          feet.

          Unlike the rest of the house, this space is pristine and
          organized: one half designated as an impressive wood shop,
          the other an office space with a lazy boy recliner and tube
          television.
                         
          John sits at his desk with a pencil in hand, a pad of paper
          before him, thinking.
                         
          A long beat... and he sighs with a smile, placing the pencil
          upon the pad before sliding them both aside.
                         
          John unscrews the cap off the bottle of scotch and pours
          himself a healthy dose.
                         
          He opens his desk drawer, reaches into the back, and finds an
          old pack of cigarettes, half-empty. He taps one from, places
          it between his lips, and lights it, taking a deep pull. He
          holds it, and exhales, his body relaxing.
                         
          He finishes his drink along with the cigarette, pours himself
          another...
                         
          ...and then opens a BOTTLE OF PILLS (The label reading NORMA
          WICK and OXYCONTIN), pouring them into a small mound upon the
          desk. He stares at them for a long moment...

          John closing the door behind him...
                         
          ...and is startled by a small BARK.
                         
          A beat... and he looks down to find that he is actually
          holding a small PET CARRIER. He lifts it to look inside:
          the face of a young, tri-colored (black, white, and brown),
          CHORGI (half-Corgi, half-Chihuahua) looks out at him, her
          tail wagging fiercely.
                         
          She barks again, and John lowers it, confused.

          Holding the envelope in his hands, John sits across from the
          carrier which he has set upon the table. Inside, the Chorgi
          lies with paws crossed, studying him, tilting her head from
          side to side.
                         
          A beat... and John opens the letter. The card inside is
          simple; white with a single DAISY drawn upon it. John smiles,
          instantly knowing who it is from, running a thumb along the
          face of the flower. He hesitates, but opens the card.

          John lowers the letter, wipes the tears from his cheeks, and

          devours her meal.

          lies in the sun, fast asleep. The vehicle is pristine: fully

          tongue wagging in the air. John is in his element: calm,
          cool, and collected behind the wheel of his car... almost as
          if it is a natural extension of himself. He deftly shifts
          gears, reaching speeds in excess of 120 miles per hour before
          hitting a long patch of gravel, shifting, spinning the wheel,
          and skidding -while remaining in full control- as the wheels
          skim over the earth. Moose barks. John smiles, reaching
          over to scratch her on the back.

          Sitting at the desk, John pauses from cleaning a pistol to
          empty the wine into his glass. Once done, he pulls back the
          slide, studies the pistol with a keen eye, releases it,
          carefully loads a clip with bullets, and slides it into the
          pistol: locked and loaded.
                         
          From a small wooden case, John selects a SILENCER which he
          screws onto the pistol. He sets it down next to a pump-
          action sawed-off SHOTGUN, a SNIPER RIFLE, an old school UZI

          A beat... and John stands, slips the silenced pistol into the
          back of his pants, dons his jacket, turns off the light, and
          leaves.

          A bustling mecca of commerce, the port never sleeps; ships
          of all shapes and sizes dock, empty their shipment, refilled
          with return cargo, and slip out into the night.
                         
          A multi-hulled beast of a ship, THE CHAYKA (Seagull) rests
          dock-side, its bridge guarded by a small army of security
          guards.

          John strips and -using the hose attachment- rinses his body
          clean: the damage is extensive with cuts, bruises, and three
          bullet holes (one in his shoulder, one his side, and one in
          his chest).
                         
          John studies the bullet wounds.

          John swallows a handful of pills, clenches his teeth, and -
          using a pair of needle nose pliers- reaches into the wound,
          searching...

          John cleans the wounds with disinfectant, applies a number of
          pads/bandages, and studies himself in the mirror: he is a
          complete and total wreck... but alive.

          the room, he stares at the young dog, studying it.
                         
          The dog makes no sound, tilting it's head from side to side.
                         
          A beat... and John walks to the cage, removing the clipboard
          from its side, reading it: we can see that the dog is
          scheduled to be put down tomorrow.
