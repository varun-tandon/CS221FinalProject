     Dark and cramped. The soft red light of fire seeps through
     iron slats. Inside this cage is a man, bound by chains.

     It's THOR. His beard is long and his clothes are worn. That
     rough, grizzled look of a man who's spent years on the road.

     He awakens with a JOLT.   Looks around.

</b>                 Now I know what you're thinking.
                 Oh no! Thor's in a cage. How did
                 this happen?
                     (then:)
                 Well, sometimes you have to get
                 captured just to get a straight
                 answer out of somebody. It's a long
                 story but basically I'm a bit of a
                 hero. See, I spent some time on
                 earth, fought some robots, saved
                 the planet a couple of times. Then
                 I went searching through the cosmos
                 for some magic, colorful Infinity
                 Stone things... didn't find any.
                 That's when I came across a path of
                 death and destruction which led me
                 all the way here into this cage...
                 where I met you.

                 be here?

     NOISE.    Sounds of metal gears TURNING.

     Suddenly the bottom DROPS OUT! Thor PLUMMETS until - SHLINK!
     Chains CINCH and abruptly halt his descent. Thor dangles six
     feet off the ground. Pull back to reveal we are in-

    A cavernous space. The walls, floors, and ceilings are
    molten rock, which has creepy glimmers of fire within it.
    Stationed in the center is a volcanic rock throne, and
    sitting in that throne is a charred demonic skeleton.

<b>                        SURTUR (O.S.)
</b>              Thor, Son of Odin.

    Thor's chain turns to reveal-

    -SURTUR on his throne. Eighteen-feet-tall, flesh made of
    fire, and demonic spiked horns on his skull.

<b>                         THOR
</b>              Surtur. Son of a bitch...you're
              still alive! I thought my father
              killed you, like, half a million
              years ago.

<b>                        SURTUR
</b>              I cannot die. Not until I fulfill
              my destiny and lay waste to your
              home.

<b>                        THOR
</b>              You know, it's funny you should
              mention that because I've been
              having these terrible dreams of
              late. Asgard up in flames, falling
              to ruins, and you Surtur are at the
              center of all of them.

<b>                        SURTUR
</b>              Then you have seen Ragnarok, the
              fall of Asgard. The great prophecy--

<b>                         THOR (O.S.)
</b>              Hang on.   Hang on.

    Reveal that Thor's chain is turning VERY SLOWLY.

<b>                        THOR (CONT'D)
</b>              I'll be back around shortly. I
              really feel like we were connecting
              there.

    After a beat, Thor rotates around to face Surtur.

<b>                        THOR (CONT'D)
</b>              Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about
              that. Walk me through it.
<b>                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16           3.
</b>

<b>                    SURTUR
</b>          My time has come. When my crown is
          reunited with the Eternal Flame, I
          shall be restored to my full might.
          I will tower over the mountains and
          bury my sword deep in Asgard's--

<b>                    THOR
</b>          Oh, hang on. Give it a second.

Once again, Thor is turning VERY SLOWLY.

<b>                    THOR (CONT'D)
</b>          I swear I'm not even moving, it's
          just doing this on its own. I'm
          really sorry.
              (then:)
          Okay, let me get this straight.
          You're going to put your crown into
          the Eternal Flame, and then you'll
          suddenly grow as big as a house--

<b>                    SURTUR
</b>          A mountain!

<b>                    THOR
</b>          The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps
          locked away on Asgard?

Surtur grins, evil.

<b>                    SURTUR
</b>          Odin is not on Asgard. And your
          absence has left the throne
          defenseless.

That elicits a concerned look from Thor.

<b>                    THOR
</b>          Okay, so where is it? This crown?

<b>                    SURTUR
</b>          This is my Crown, the source of my
          power.

Surtur points at the V-shaped horns on his head..

<b>                    THOR
</b>          Oh, that's a crown? I thought it
          was a big eyebrow.

<b>                    SURTUR
</b>          It's a crown.
<b>                       BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   4.
</b>

<b>                     THOR
</b>           Anyway, it sounds like all I have
           to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that
           thing off your head.

Surtur stands up and approaches Thor, DRAGGING his sword.

<b>                     SURTUR
</b>           But Ragnarok has   already begun. You
           cannot stop it.    I am Asgard's
           doom, and so are   you. All will
           suffer, all will   burn.

Surtur steps forward and GRABS the chain above Thor's feet,
holding it so he and Thor are face to face.

<b>                     THOR
</b>           That's intense. To be honest,
           seeing you grow really big and set
           fire to a planet would be quite the
           spectacle. But it looks like I'm
           going to have to go with option B
           where I bust out of these chains,
           knock that tiara off your head, and
           stash it away in Asgard's vault.

<b>                     SURTUR
</b>           You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight
           it?

Behind his back, Thor opens his hand.    Sending out the SOS.

<b>                     THOR
</b>           Because that's what heroes do.

Nothing happens.   Thor appears annoyed at himself.

<b>                     THOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Wait, sorry. I didn't time that
           right.
               (pause)
           And, now!

BOOM!   Thor's hammer Mjolnir CRASHES through the wall!

Thor BREAKS FREE from his chains, GRABS Mjolnir, spins, and
flies a distance away. He FLINGS Mjolnir back at Surtur,
smashing the giant in the face. Mjolnir returns.

<b>                     SURTUR
</b>           You have made a grave mistake,
           Odinson.
<b>                           BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16                   5.
</b>

    THE WALLS COME ALIVE! A seemingly infinite swarm of FIRE
    DEMONS rally to Surtur's aid.

<b>                         THOR
</b>               I make grave mistakes all the time.
               Everything seems to work out.

    In the shadows, a massive FIRE DRAGON ROARS.

    The fire demons SURGE FORWARD. Thor backs up, HAMMERING
    AWAY. He then leaps back, SPRINGBOARDS off the wall, and-

    -LANDS HARD, SLAMMING Mjolnir down. The resulting shockwave
<b>    KNOCKS BACK THE LEGION OF FIRE DEMONS.
</b>
    The Fire Dragon STRAINS against a chain leash.

    Thor is now facing off with Surtur. Surtur thrusts his hands
    at Thor, generating a humongous PROJECTILE WALL OF FIRE!

    Thor SPINS Mjolnir so fast that it creates a kind of SHIELD.

    The God of Thunder and the Fire Giant engage in ferocious
    hand-to-hand combat. Each landing power shots, sending
    sparks of both fire and electricity into the air.

    Thor SLIPS behind Surtur and TAKES OUT his knees. Thor then
    LAUNCHES HIGH into the air and summons a HUGE LIGHTNING BOLT.
    Descending hard, he uses all his power to-

    -LOP SURTUR'S HEAD OFF OF HIS BODY! Surtur's body DEFLATES
    and COLLAPSES into a heap of charred bones.

    Thor straps the crowned skull to his back. He turns to find-

    -the army of Fire Demons regrouping as reinforcements flood
    in, filling the space to capacity. Recognizing the threat,
    Thor thrusts Mjolnir above his head.

<b>                         THOR (CONT'D)
</b>               Heimdall. I know it's been a while,
               but I could use a fast exit!

    Nothing.   Thor just stands there as the Fire Demons advance.

<b>                         THOR (CONT'D)
</b>               ...Heimdall?

    Heimdall is nowhere to be found. Instead, we meet SKURGE.
    He's bald, strong, mean looking, a little eager to be liked.

    At the moment, Skurge is entertaining two ASGARDIAN WOMEN.

<b>                         SKURGE
</b>              Heimdall was an idiot. This job
              should have made him rich. Now,
              the job ain't easy, but it does
              have its benefits. The Bi-Frost
              gives me access to everything the
              Nine Realms have to offer. I mean
              it's all mine for the taking.
                  (beat)
              Behold...my stuff.

    Skurge has drawn their attention to a pile of weapons and
    treasures he has stashed off to the side.

    He hefts up two M-16 assault rifles, trying to play it cool.

<b>                        SKURGE (CONT'D)
</b>              I'm particularly fond of these. I
              pulled `em out of a place on
              Midgard called Texas. I even named
              them. Des and Troy. You see, when
              you put them together...they
              destroy.

    Thor CRASHES out of the ground and LANDS on a craggy surface.
    Disoriented and singed from the fire demon onslaught.

    Thor's cloak is on fire, and he frantically PATS OUT the
    flames. He picks up Mjolnir, holds it up once more. Nothing.

<b>                        THOR
</b>              Heimdall, come on.

    THE GROUND SHAKES! Like an earthquake. Thor backs up as the
    ground begins to give way all around him. And then-

    -THE FEARSOME FIRE DRAGON BURSTS OUT OF THE GROUND! The
    dragon opens its tremendous jaws for an ear-splitting roar...

     ...but Thor STUFFS Mjolnir into its mouth and lets go.

     THUD! The hammer DROPS, pinning the beast down by its bottom
     jaw. It THRASHES and GROWLS, trying to break free.

      THOR arrives with Surtur's skull.

      There's a small crowd making its way through a threshold over
      which stands a monumental statue of Loki, arms out-stretched
      in the `savior' pose.

      Confused, Thor turns to a theater patron.

      LOKI falls into frame, GASPING FOR BREATH... although it's
      not Loki. This is ACTOR LOKI and we're watching a STAGE PLAY.

      In the background, a single musician plays the haunting score
      from THOR: THE DARK WORLD on a pan flute.

      Suddenly, ACTOR THOR leans into shot, holding Actor Loki.

Odin mouths Actor Loki's final line along with him.

Actor Loki then "dies".

The brothers freeze in a TABLEAU as ACTOR ODIN steps forward.

<b>                    ACTOR ODIN
</b>          And so Loki died of his wounds,
          giving his life for ours. He
          fought back those disgusting dark
          elves. He brought peace to the
          realm.

He takes a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY, PAINTED BLUE, into his arms.

</b>          Loki, my boy...`Twas many moons ago
          I found you on a frost-bitten
          battlefield.

Thor watches, incredulous. He then notices that a woman next
to him is openly SOBBING at the play.

<b>                    ACTOR ODIN (CONT'D)
</b>          On that day, I did not yet see in
          you Asgard's savior. No. You were
          merely a little blue baby icicle...
          that melted this old fool's heart.

The crowd erupts in rapturous applause. The players bow. Odin
stands up, leading the crowd in this STANDING OVATION.

Odin sees Thor taking a knee.   Curses under his breath:

<b>                    ODIN
</b>          Oh, shit.
              (then, announcing)
          My son! Thor has returned!
          Greetings my boy.

Odin goes through a weird internal transformation. His
fluidity is replaced by a rigid and regal posture. He bats
away his maiden and turns to Thor, who stands up.

<b>                     THOR
</b>          It's an interesting play.    What's

</b>          Indeed they should.
              (provoking)
          I like that statue. A lot better
          looking than he was when he was
          alive, though. A little less
          weasely. Less greasy maybe.

Odin sours, masking his agitation.    Thor holds up the skull.

<b>                    THOR (CONT'D)
</b>          You know what this is?

<b>                    ODIN (ADR)
</b>          The skull of Surtur? That's a
          formidable weapon.

Thor approaches an E-Guard and hands it over.

<b>                    THOR
</b>          Do me a favor. Lock this in a
          vault so it doesn't turn into a
          giant monster and destroy the whole
          planet.

<b>                    ODIN
</b>          So it's back to Midgard for you, is
          it?

Thor starts YO-YOing Mjolnir, turns back to Odin.

<b>                    THOR
</b>          Nope. I've been having this

<b>                    THOR

          out there and investigate. And
          what do I find, but the Nine Realms

          Asgard assembling, plotting our

          sitting here in your bathrobe,
          eating grapes.

Thor SPINS Mjolnir and then HURLS it off into the distance,
GRABS Odin by the back of the neck.

Odin's royal attendants GASP in shock. The Einherjar
bodyguards rush Thor, but he KICKS them away.

The jig is up.   A shimmering illusion dissipates, revealing:

<b>                    LOKI
</b>          Alright, I yield!

Thor DROPS Loki to the ground and catches Mjolnir. Loki
looks to Thor, hands up defensively. Skurge arrives on the
scene, a little late to warn Loki.

Thor now has a stein of beer in his hand. He drinks it
throughout the scene, but it always stays full.

<b>          STRANGE
</b>So I keep a watch list of
individuals and beings from other
realms that may be a threat to this
world. Your adopted brother Loki
is one of these beings.

<b>          THOR
</b>He's a worthy inclusion.

<b>          STRANGE
</b>Then why bring him here?

<b>          THOR
</b>We're looking for my father.

</b>So. If you were to tell you where
Odin was, all parties concerned
would promptly return to Asgard?

</b>If you knew where he was, why
didn't you call me?

<b>           DR. STRANGE
</b>I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed. Your
father said he had chosen to remain
in exile.
    (beat)
And you don't have a phone.

<b>          THOR
</b>No, I don't have a phone, but you
could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.

<b>          STRANGE
</b>Yeah, do you have a computer?

Anyway, my father is no longer in
exile. So if you could tell me
where he is, I can take him home.

      Strange stands up and suddenly they are standing by a book-
      case. Strange takes down an ancient book, flips through it.

<b>                          STRANGE
</b>                I'm just seeing whether this
                incantation requires any Asgardian

      Thor reaches out to the bookcase to steady himself.

<b>                           STRANGE (CONT'D)
</b>                Nope.

      Suddenly they are both across the room at Strange's work
      station. Because Thor was touching the bookcase, he has
      magically brought it across the room as well.

<b>                          STRANGE (CONT'D)
</b>                Oh, we don't need that.

      Suddenly Thor is back across the room.   Books fall off the
      shelf and Thor's beer spills.

      He is queasy and unsteady from the teleporting.

<b>                          THOR
</b>                Will you stop doing that?

<b>                          STRANGE
</b>                I need just one strand of your

      Strange is behind Thor, he plucks a strand of hair.

      Strange extends the hair, infuses it with magic, does a few
      gestures that create a BRIGHT LIGHT and suddenly-

      Bottom of the stairs. Strange is standing. Thor is rolling
      down the stairs. A magic portal leading into a peaceful
      meadow has opened beside Strange.

</b>          Don't forget your umbrella.

<b>                       THOR
</b>          Yes.

Thor extends his arm and holds out his hand.    Crashing noises
are heard. Lots of crashing noises.

<b>                       THOR (CONT'D)
</b>          Sorry

Finally the umbrella flies into his hand.

<b>                    THOR (CONT'D)

          back.

<b>                    DR. STRANGE
</b>          Yeah, right.

Suddenly we hear SCREAMING.

From above, LOKI drops out of a portal. He LANDS HARD on the
floor and then STAGGERS to his feet. On edge, confused.

     A lone figure stands at the other side of the meadow at the
     cliff's edge, waves CRASHING below.

     It is ODIN. He's dressed plainly in humble human clothes.
     The boys approach him quickly.

     Thor fires a look at Loki, who holds up his hands in defense.

Odin turns to Loki, who stiffens.    But Odin smiles.

<b>                    ODIN
</b>          Took me quite a while to break free
          from your spell. Frigga would have
          been proud.

Loki is moved by this gesture. He looks over to see Thor
staring at him, anger building.

Odin puts a hand on Thor's shoulder, calming him.

<b>                     ODIN (CONT'D)

Odin sits, out of breath, weak.    His sons sit beside him.

</b>          I know that we failed you, but we

          an end to Surtur.

<b>                    ODIN

moment together. Tears well in Thor's eyes.

Ethereal sun-rays stream down upon the ocean.

<b>                     ODIN (CONT'D)

A warm glow washes over Thor's face and he turns to see that-

<b>-ODIN IS DISSIPATING INTO STARDUST.   THE ALLFATHER HAS DIED.

A moment as the brothers separately mourn for Odin.

The sky above DARKENS and THE WIND PICKS UP.

Thor stands and turns toward Loki, his eyes burning with
rage. Loki takes a step back.

<b>                      LOKI
</b>           Brother.

Thor faces Loki.   Electricity CRACKLES at Thor's hands.

CRACK!   Behind them a black portal SPLITS OPEN!

Thor SLAMS DOWN his umbrella, transforming into his Asgardian
armor (with Mjolnir). Loki changes into his armor as well.

A piercing scream cuts the air as a figure is hurtled out of
the portal, crashing out of this dimensional rift is HELA.

Hela takes a second to consider her surroundings.   Then:

          arrangement.

<b>                    HELA

Loki shifts nervously.   Thor's grip tightens on Mjolnir.

<b>                    HELA (CONT'D)

Thor winds up and HURLS Mjolnir at Hela...

- THUD - the mighty hammer comes to a cold stop, against
Hela's hand.

Thor is shocked. He stretches out his hands, trying to call
Mjolnir back to him.

     The hammer trembles in Hela's hand, like a mini game of tug-o-
     war. But ultimately Hela keeps possession.

<b>                          THOR (CONT'D)

<b>     HELA SHATTERS THOR'S HAMMER.
</b>
     The blast of Mjolnir's destruction sends a wave of energy
     through Thor and Loki who brace themselves against the
     impact.

     Thor is stupefied. In shock. He looks up to see Hela is
     running her hands back over her head to create the terrifying
     battle headdress.

     Loki's reaction is more panic.   He stands and calls up:

<b>                          LOKI

     Thor and Loki ZOOM UPWARDS, held inside this celestial beam
     warping them towards Asgard. Loki and Thor look down to
     see... Hela is in the Bi-Frost, behind them and CATCHING UP.

     Loki turns and throws TWO DAGGERS at her. They find their
     mark, stalling her for a second. But she PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH
     Loki, KNOCKING HIM OUT OF THE BI-FROST. Gone in an instant.

<b>                          THOR

     Hela projects a jet black grappling hook and GRABS HOLD of
     Thor. Drawing him to her, preparing to finish him off. Thor
     pulls up his legs, and KICKS Hela with both feet. This
     effectively dislodges him from her grasp but also...

     ...KNOCKS THOR OUT OF THE BI-FROST! Now both he and Loki are
     gone. If they aren't dead, then God knows where they went.

Thor runs up a dune to get away from the shower of debris.

<b>                    LEAD SCRAPPER
</b>          It is food. On your knees.

Thor reaches out to summon Mjolnir.    A reflex.   Nothing.

The LEAD SCRAPPER levels a MAGNO-RIFLE at Thor and WHAP! A
solid metal projectile KNOCKS Thor flat on his back. More
Scrappers attack, throwing nets and firing more projectiles.
Thor tries to swat them away but they keep coming. The rest
of the scrappers move in with iron bats and clubs.

WHOOSH! A second ship arrives, landing nearby. It's cool,
sleek, and dangerous, deserving of its name: WARSONG. It is
also BLASTING DIFFERENT WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC.

The FRONT of Warsong FLIPS OPEN and a GANGPLANK extends down
to the ground. The scrappers stop and stare as we TRACK IN to
a HERO REVEAL of SCRAPPER #142 (S142 for short) - a beautiful
and ruthless asskicker.

S142 lifts a half-empty bottle to her lips and CHUGS it. She
finishes the bottle and smashes it on the side of her ship.

<b>                       SCRAPPER #142
</b>          He's MINE.

She walks down the gangplank... before veering off course and
FALLING straight off into a pile of TRASH. She's PLASTERED.

The Scrappers shrug and start hauling Thor away.

<b>                       SCRAPPER #142 (CONT'D)
</b>          Wait!

S142 staggers to her feet, takes a deep breath. She holds on
to a piece of junk as support - some dead beast. Thor
continues to struggle with his captors, tangled in nets.

<b>                    SCRAPPER #142 (CONT'D)
</b>          Wait! He's mine. So if you want
          him, you go through me.

The Scrappers start brandishing their weapons.

<b>                    SCRAPPER
</b>          But we've already got him.

S142 CLANGS her metal gauntlets together which activate.

<b>                    SCRAPPER #142
</b>          Alright then I guess I go through
          you.

<b>                       LEAD SCRAPPER
</b>          More food.

She holds out her fists as if she's operating machinery...

...Warsong WHIRS to life. S142 clenches her fists and we hear
a horrible SCREECHING NOISE as Warsong OPENS FIRE.

She sweeps her arms out in an arc, the spray of gunfire
lasting THREE SECONDS. She bangs her fists again, sending the
ship into IDLE MODE. The Scrappers are now little more than
tiny pieces of litter covering the beach.

Thor is fixated on this beautiful murderer approaching. One
final HUGE Scrapper comes at her with a bat. S142 casually
GRABS this Scrapper and HURLS him up into the air behind her.

<b>                       THOR
</b>          Thank you.

From her belt S142 FLICKS a small glowing disc which LODGES
into Thor's NECK. Far in the background, the Scrapper she
threw finally HITS the ground with a loud THUD.

She holds up a fob device and presses the button - the disc
blinks and Thor is filled with the pain of a thousand
screaming squirrels. He hits the ground, stunned.

S142 DRAGS Thor towards her ship.

     Thor's POV - THE CAPITAL - an eclectic city composed of
     salvaged items from all over the universe.

     Thor is lying in a sort of small GLASS HOLDING CELL beneath
     Warsong's COCKPIT. He looks up to see S142 piloting the ship.

     Thor's eyes lock in on her belt, specifically the fob device
     she used to activate the Obedience Disk/debilitate him.

<b>                          THOR
</b>               Hey!   Where are you taking me?

     S142 ignores him, takes a swig from the bottle, and then
     nonchalantly UNCLIPS the fob from her belt.

Thor claws at the obedience disk, trying to RIP IT OUT.

He gets some separation from his skin, but the disk is
causing him even more pain. Thor eventually has to let go.
Grandmaster holds up HIS OWN fob device and uses it like a
wand to guide Thor's HOVER CHAIR, which follows Grandmaster
around as he speaks.

JABS it into his cousin's mid-section-

Grandmaster and Thor arrive at a space where A GROUP OF
MUSICIANS PLAY STRANGE INSTRUMENTS (the source of the music
thus far). Grandmaster joins them, still speaking to Thor.

Grandmaster begins PLAYING a strange piano-like contraption,
riffing a melody over the existing music.

<b>                    GRANDMASTER (CONT'D)
</b>          My name is Grandmaster. I preside
          over a little harlequinade called
          the Contest of Champions. People
          come from far and wide to
          unwillingly participate in it. And
          you, my friend, might just be part
          of the new cast. What do you say
          to that?

<b>                    THOR
</b>          We're not friends, and I don't give
          a shit about your games! I'm going
          back to Asgard!

          Ass-gard?
              (then:)
          One, two, three, four.

Grandmaster really gets into his PLAYING. Grandmaster's
guards and VIP guests start MOVING TO THE MUSIC.

Thor takes a moment to look around at this bizarre spectacle
unfolding around him. In doing so, he zeroes in on one
particular group of VIPS, specifically...

...LOKI! He's lounging and dressed in Sakaarian garb.

<b>                    LOKI
</b>          There was a wormhole in space and
          time beneath me. At that moment, I
          let go.

<b>                    THOR
</b>          Loki!? Loki! Over here!

Loki notices Thor. Blanches a little. Sidles closer so as
to speak to Thor without looking like he's speaking to Thor.

<b>                    LOKI
</b>          Excuse me one second.

</b>          What?   You're alive?

          I'm stuck in this stupid chair.
          Where's your chair?

<b>                    LOKI
</b>          I didn't get a chair.

<b>                    THOR

          He's called the Grandmaster.

Suddenly Grandmaster is right next to them.

Both Thor and Loki react, startled.

uncomfortable silence.

     Thor is shoved into a spacious cell where other alien
     prisoners are lurking in the back.

     The thick cell door SLAMS SHUT behind Thor. Thor gets up and
     immediately begins THROWING his shoulder into the door. The
     door doesn't budge, not even a little.

     Behind him, KORG, a hulking Kronan rock alien, speaks up.

behind Korg.

<b>                      THOR (CONT'D)

Thor DODGES the first few attacks, but then Hulk SHATTERS his
shield and sends Thor FLYING.

Thor draws a sword and STABS it into the ground to slow his
momentum. Draws the other sword and faces off against Hulk.

<b>                    THOR (CONT'D)
</b>          Banner, we're friends. This is
          crazy. I don't want to hurt you!

They engage again.   Hulk KICKS Thor, sending him SLAMMING
into the wall.

<b>                    GRANDMASTER
</b>          Here we go.

Thor jumps down just in time to avoid Hulk's warhammer, which
HITS so hard that it remains lodged in the wall.

With Hulk charging again, Thor RIPS the warhammer out of the
wall and WALLOPS Hulk with it.

Hulk goes CRASHING alongside the arena. He ends up sprawled
out in a pile of rubble, slightly dazed.

Thor advances on Hulk with all the swagger. He takes off his
helmet and CALLS OUT to Hulk, provoking him.

<b>                    THOR
</b>          Hey, big guy. The sun's getting
          real low.

<b>                    THOR (CONT'D)
</b>          That's it. The sun's going down.
          I won't hurt you anymore. No one
          will.

WHOOSH! Thor is suddenly dragged out of frame. Hulk has
Thor by the leg and is WHIPPING him against the arena floor.
Over and over and over again.

IN THE VIP BOX: Loki's whole mood shifts. The joy returns to
his face, like "everything will be alright!" Loki LAUGHS.

<b>                    LOKI

Thor is SMASHED into the floor face first.

Hulk ROARS and RUSHES Thor with his axe.

<b>                    THOR
</b>          All right. Screw it.

CLANG! The giant weapons CLASH! Now Thor and Hulk are
fighting warhammer versus battleaxe...

...and Thor is winning! He's getting the better of these
exchanges, using Hulk's aggression against him. Thor
continually KNOCKS and/or TRIPS Hulk off his feet while
evading all of Hulk's best attacks.

<b>                    THOR (CONT'D)
</b>          I know you're in there, Banner.
          I'll get you out!

One particular vicious blow DISARMS Hulk, and Thor BREAKS
Hulk's axe with the warhammer. Thor then BASHES Hulk in the
chest, KNOCKING him to the ground.

<b>                    THOR (CONT'D)

GROWLING, Hulk stands up and HITS Thor with a straight jab
that sends Thor TUMBLING across the arena. Hulk immediately
LEAPS after him and LANDS ON Thor!

Hulk is now on top of Thor as they slide across the arena,
just PUMMELING him with punches. Left-right-left-right.
Thor's head snaps back and forth.

In the carnage, Thor sees VISIONS OF ODIN.   Then-

-his eyes GLOW WHITE WITH ELECTRICITY. Like an instinctual
defense mechanism, Thor suddenly KNOCKS HULK BACK WITH A
<b>BURST OF LIGHTNING!
</b>
Seething with electricity, Thor springs to his feet and then
BLASTS HULK WITH A MASSIVE LIGHTNING PUNCH! Hulk is LAUNCHED
BACKWARDS and Thor hits the ground HARD.

The crowd gets hushed.   They've never seen this before.

IN THE VIP BOX: Grandmaster is pissed.   Loki is amazed.

Hulk and Thor stagger to their feet. Thor looks at himself,
a little surprised. There are still small charges of
lightning CRACKLING through his veins.

Meanwhile, Hulk RUMBLES towards Thor and they're at it again,
close-quarters boxing. Thor is winning the exchanges,
landing BRUTAL PUNCHES to Hulk's body. And then suddenly-

-BZZZ! The Grandmaster ZAPS him with the Obedience Disk fob!
Thor drops, totally caught off guard!

Hulk plants his feet and JUMPS! He ZOOMS UP, rocketing out
of the arena, up-up-up into the sky! At the apex of his jump
Hulk clenches his fist and begins a missile-like descent.

Val sees this from her ship and decides to take off, like
"This fight is over, time to beat traffic."

Down below, Thor groggily turns over. He does so just in
time to see Hulk coming at him like an atom bomb!

No time to avoid it. KA-BOOM!!! Right before impact Thor's
eyes go lightning white. Hulk HITS Thor like a meteor.

       Hot on their heels are a pair of Hela's sinister Butchers,
       hunting like a pack of wolves.

       After scrambling through a grove of trees the family make

      are swabbing his wounds. This freaks him out, which results

Thor starts to get up, but then winces.      He moves slowly.

He's in a GIANT ROOM with stark graphic patterns on the
walls. With a few achy grimaces, Thor stands up and wanders
around. There's furniture, large cushions, and a sleeping
area enclosed by the SKULL of a giant beast.

NOISE behind him.    Thor follows the noise to find-

Hulk having eased himself into a large steaming JACUZZI. Thor
looks at him quizzically. Hulk isn't angry. He's RELAXED,
but he's not turning into Banner.

Thor takes this in, and then walks over to a window that
looks out across the city. Does some spatial math, realizes:
Thor looks back out the window.

He sees a ramshackle SPACESHIP taking off and ROCKETING
skyward. Higher and higher, it's going for a wormhole when-

Thor heads for the exit, a wide open door.

      ZAP! Thor's jolted back by the obedience disk.       There are
      perimeter sensors in the doorway.

      Hulk CHUCKLES at Thor as he hits the floor.      Points.

      Hulk grabs his giant battleaxe.       He's armored up.

      Hulk exits. Thor watches him go. Then, at the end of the
      hallway Hulk meets up with Valkyrie! They begin play-
      fighting, a clearly friendly rapport.

      Thor can't believe it. He runs to the entrance, but by the
      time he reaches the perimeter sensors they are gone.

      Thor sighs. Walks over to the window. Looks up through a
      wormhole, stars twinkling on the other end of it.

      Pause. Then Thor's eyes go golden like Heimdall's!         The
      stars in the wormhole begin to WARP OVER THOR AND-

</b>
       Thor suddenly finds himself in Asgard. Disoriented at first,
       Thor turns to see Heimdall hiding in the shadows.

       Heimdall harshly SHUSHES Thor and gestures for him to get up
       against the wall. Thor complies. Sees the refugees.

       After a beat a roving patrol of Hela's Butchers creep by
       through the street. They don't spot our heroes. Pause.

       Heimdall turns to Thor, speaks only in hushed whispers.

<b>                           HEIMDALL
</b>                 I see you. But you are far away.

</b>                 Come see for yourself.

       Without warning, Heimdall leads the family out of the alley
       and DASHES down the street. Thor follows...

       ...but then stops. Looks around to see THE OCCUPIED CITY OF
       ASGARD, emitting a smoky aura of chaos. A chilling sight.

       Down the street, Heimdall gestures for the family to slow
       down. He sees something. Ushers them into an alcove.

       Thor joins them just in time to avoid being seen by another
       roving patrol of Hela's Butchers. Heimdall again motions for
       Thor to "shh" until the threat has passed. Then:

Back to Thor and Heimdall.

<b>                        HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
</b>           Come on.

As Heimdall quickly leads refugees down a safe pathway:

<b>                     HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>           Hela is ravenous. If I let her
           leave, she'll consume the Nine

Turns back to Thor, approaches him.

</b>           We need you.

<b>                     THOR
</b>           I'm working on it, but I don't even
           really know where the hell I am.

Two packs of Butchers arrive simultaneously.        Spot Heimdall.

<b>                     HEIMDALL
</b>           You're on a planet surrounded by

<b>                        THOR
</b>           Which one?

Heimdall RIPS into the attacking Butchers, CUTTING them down.

<b>                     HEIMDALL
</b>           The big one!

<b>WHOOSH!   SUDDENLY THOR'S GONE!     BLACK.

After slashing through the Butchers, Heimdall moves towards
the house where he hid the family... and then abruptly stops.

Heimdall turns slightly.       He sees something.

BINOCULARS POV: Heimdall looking right at us, the Bi-Frost
sword visible in his hand.

Reveal Skurge on a palace tower balcony, surveilling the city
with Asgardian E-noculars. Skurge lowers the E-noculars.

There is conflict on his face. He knows that he should report
this to Hela immediately...yet he doesn't spring into action.

We follow Two Palace Guards as they enter Hulk's Suite.

Hulk is throwing a LARGE BALL against the far wall. It's so
hard it makes dents in the wall. Hulk stops and turns.

Reveal that the guards are escorting Valkyrie. They leave...
Valkyrie and Hulk face off.

Hulk steps away, allowing Valkyrie to see Thor. Her smile
disappears. She stares at Hulk, so annoyed. Hulk mopes a
little. Like, "I done bad." Turns back to Thor:

<b>                      VALKYRIE (CONT'D)

Valkyrie looks him up and down. Obedience Disks to the max.

Hulk begins BOUNCING his ball against the wall again.

Valkyrie walks over to Hulk's bar, picks up an UNOPENED
BOTTLE of liquor. Hulk snorts, disapprovingly. Val puts it
down and finds something cheaper, she pops the cork.

She has indeed finished. She goes to leave.

Valkyrie stops short (the BALL BANGING noise continues). Her
silence speaks volumes. Thor has a realization.

Hulk's ball rolls into frame. An off screen GRUNT.   Val
picks it up and tosses it back to Hulk.

          her banishment, he sent the
          Valkyrie in to fight her back. I
          only survived because...
              (trails off, brooding)
          Look, I already faced her once back
          when I believed in the throne, and
          it cost me everything. THAT'S
          what's wrong with Asgard. The
          throne, the secrets, the whole
          golden sham.

Pause. Thor moves towards Valkyrie, goes to put a comforting
hand on her shoulder.

Val SNATCHES his hand.   They are close, face to face.

          the crown. This is about the

message from NATASHA ROMANOFF on the console.

head, trying to fight this back. But he can't help it...

...HE'S TRANSFORMING BACK INTO BRUCE BANNER! The transition
is rough and chaotic, it's as if Banner is fighting to get
out of the Hulk. Throughout the process, Hulk SMASHES back

     A barren black void of death.

     The VALKYRIE, in old school Asgardian armor, charge through
     the DIMENSIONAL RIFT, an open portal to Asgard and the Nine
     Realms. Val witnesses these events as moments frozen in time.

     - Reveal Hela in all her glory, black lightning everywhere.

     - Dozens of Valkyrie falling through the dark space.

     - The Valkyrie's winged horses lay dead on the battlefield.

     - Through the open portal we can see the throne of Asgard.

     - Hela advancing on the final few Valkyrie - one is Val,
     frozen in fear, shell-shocked.

     - Val scrambling to her feet and trying to re-enter the rift

      Inside the parade it is total chaos. Thor searches for Banner
      as he's PELTED with green powder. Pandemonium. In the crowd
      Thor sees a pack of SCRAPPERS on the hunt for the reward.

      Thor spots Banner. He surges forward, GRABS Banner, and
      pulls him into another alley, but sees-

      Thor pulls Banner back into the crowd. Thor briefly turns to
      see that he is no longer holding Banner's - it's the arm of a
      SMALL ALIEN who squeals in fright.

      Thor sees Banner across the crowd.

      Thor MUSCLES his way through the madness, knocking rowdy fans
      aside. He reaches Banner and holds him protectively,
      awkwardly trying to rub his shoulders.

      One of the aliens Thor knocked aside turns out to be a
      MASSIVE SCRAPPER. He rears up, turning on Thor and Banner.

      WHAM! From out of nowhere, Valkyrie CLOCKS this Scrapper
      with a brass knuckle right cross. The Scrapper DROPS.

      Thor looks at Val while clutching Banner like a child.

      Val pilots the Commodore towards the battle on the city side
      of the bridge. Skurge's battlion of Butchers surge forward-

      -BOOM! Val LANDS the Commodore on top of them, SKIDDING
      across the bridge, CRUSHING the front line of the Butchers,
      and KNOCKING Skurge aside. The impact triggers the party
      function, setting off PARTY MUSIC and a FIREWORKS DISPLAY.

      Val emerges from the ship in full battle mode. Behind her,
      the Commodore FIREWORKS provide a spectacular HERO BACKDROP.
      She draws DRAGONFANG and smiles as Butchers begin swarming

      Meanwhile, the Asgardians huddle together, packed so tight
      that some begin to fall off the side of the bridge, loved

Heimdall is beyond confused, but then... a LOUD NOISE. Hela
looks down to see-

-EMERGING FROM THE THICK LOW-HANGING FOG IS LOKI! Resplendent
in horns, arms spread wide, seeming to float towards the
bridge like a mythical angel of mercy.

on THE GRANDMASTER'S SUPERCRUISER! For reasons that will
become clear, we will henceforth call this ship THE ARK.

And Loki is not alone. He's brought along all the prisoners
from the Contest of Champions. Armed with gladiator weapons.
The Ark slows to a stop at the middle of bridge.

The Asgardian refugees begin POURING onto the ark. The only
way onto the Ark is a narrow plankway, so there is an
immediate bottleneck effect - thousands of frightened people
all pushing for a chance at salvation. It's mayhem.

      It's not doing much damage, but the shock of it plus Hulk's

      Hulk is trying to rip out one of Surtur's horns when Surtur
      reaches up and GRABS HIM with a giant fiery hand.

      Surtur HURLS Hulk away from him.   Sends him CRASHING DOWN.
