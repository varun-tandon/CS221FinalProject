    A series of shots.

    Blue sky through shabby windows.
    Run down walls. A paint splashed pine floor.    Tens of paint
    brushes soaking in stained jars.
    An artisan's hands - weather-worn, swirling a paint brush
    in dirty water that sways at the bottom of one of the jars.

    A canvas - the sketched face of a woman - blonde, blue eyed
    as the artisan strokes paint into her features - a poster
    girl for 18th century portraiture. (We will later
    recognise her as ELIZABETH MURRAY)

    A swallow cuts across a red tinged sky.   SOUND of footsteps
    trudging through mud.
    EXTREME CLOSE UP: a small figure being dressed by someone -
    a shoulder, an arm, little hands. We do not see a face.
    CLOSE: heavy naval boots move at sombre pace through slums.

    Against a stone floor, a child's feet are laced into boots.

    A starving dog barks , darts between tradesmen, sailors.

    A CHILD'S POV as the door opens. We see a gentleman in
    ceremonial naval dress - CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY,
    aristocratic, handsome...alarmed at the sight before him.

    His eyes close with some sad, internal pain and as they re-
    open...We see what he sees...
    A fragile girl...around six years old stands in shabby
    surroundings. Her terrified eyes stare back, leaving
    LINDSAY at a loss. He takes in her features - delicate
    with a full mouth that underlines her ethnicity.

    She is DIDO ELIZABETH BELLE...part black, part white.

    He speaks quietly- words almost as fragile as she is.

<b>                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
</b>              Hello little girl...Little Dido.

              I am your father.
    Silence. Then a tear rises to the surface and as her
    confused tears spill, so too do LINDSAY'S.

    His POV: a POOR BLACK WOMAN oversees DIDO from afar.

</b>                  (re. Dido)
              How lovely she is. So much of her
              mother.
                  (his eyes sting)
              I tried...but how...how could I
              separate a mother from her child?
                  (he restrains tears)
              And now nature has deprived me of
              such a dilemma.
    He composes himself - feeling futile...

<b>                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
</b>              Thank you..for taking her.
    He reaches into his pocket, holds out money to the woman.
<b>                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
</b>              You may leave us.

    The WOMAN hesitates, scurries to DIDO, placing her lips to
    the child's head in a prolonged kiss. Then she is gone.
    DIDO is left frightened and stunned!

<b>                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
</b>              Do not be afraid sweet thing. I
              am to take you to a good life.
              The life you were born to.

    He takes out a cube of chocolate, shows it to her. She is
    reluctant. He takes a bite - delicious! DIDO moves
    forward. He puts the chocolate in her hand. She tastes
    it. Sweet cocoa and sugar..and now her tiny mouth is
    filled. It makes LINDSAY laugh out loud.

    countryside - A neoclassical estate stretches before us.
    The figure of a LITTLE GIRL running across the lawns - her
    giggle fills the air, her outline faded by the sun.
    At French doors to the nursery, a furious greying woman -
    LADY MARY MURRAY (40s), waves a wooden spoon and yells...

    The child crashes to the grass in fits of laughter. She is
    no more than 6 years old - Hair the colour of bleached hay
    and delicate pale skin.

    She rolls on to her back, squinting at the sunlight as...

    LADY MANSFIELD (40s), the years have been kind. She is
    beautiful, regal - stares ahead in shock...
    LORD MANSFIELD (50's) - a majestic man, white wigged and
    low brows, is incandescent, his sister, LADY MARY, frozen.

          find me a fool? She is a MULATTO!

LORD MANSFIELD'S blood boils, he rages towards LINDSAY. LADY
MANSFIELD restrains him. LINDSAY is red with humiliation.

LINDSAY lowers his voice, shielding DIDO.

His firm gaze holds his aunt and uncle to account. A long
beat. LADY MANSFIELD stands conflicted.

LINDSAY stands his ground.

<b>                    LADY MARY
</b>          We cannot have another
          Elizabeth in the household.
LADY MANSFIELD regards the child, then looks to her
husband, gravely. He turns his back - aggrieved.

<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          We...we will call her Dido.
              (off Lindsay's nod)
          Good Lord, she is thin. Mary,
          find her something to eat.
LORD MANSFIELD storms from the room. LADY MANSFIELD
follows. LINDSAY kneels, choked with emotion.

<b>                    SIR JOHN LINDSAY

          with me...but a ship...it is no
          place for one so precious as you.
              (pause)
          In these walls, yours will be a
          life equal to my blood.
A beat. Through eyes that brim...he catches his breath.
LADY MARY is both stunned and moved - she has to turn away.
<b>                    SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)

          moment, but hold this in your
          heart...you are loved...Just as
          I loved your mother.
A tear spills and DIDO's little fingers come up to wipe it
from his cheek. He presses his lips to her hand, sobbing a
moment, and then he is gone - to stay any longer would be
too much to bare.

              always speaking your mind, you

    DIDO is left alone - through the doorway of the gallery, a
    portrait of LINDSAY stares at her. She gazes at it.

    LORD MANSFIELD approaches, arrested at the sight of DIDO,
    newly tidied. He follows her gaze to LINDSAY'S image. The
    sight affects him, unexpectedly.

    Her eyes search the long line of her aristocratic heritage,
    until her gaze settles. He chuckles, reluctantly charmed as
    she points to his likeness.

</b>Indeed. He discovered her mother

ship. He was charged with
conveying it back to these
shores, he tells me.
<b>          LADY MANSFIELD
</b>Evidently he had some...`feeling'

He has been at sea, six years.
All of this child's life!

</b>Well, he clearly saw to their

So...now we have two nieces in
our guardianship.
<b>           LORD MANSFIELD

Elizabeth was much in need of a
companion.

<b>          LADY MANSFIELD
</b>And that is what we shall say
when questions are asked of us?
<b>          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>We shall say that in accordance

Such...is the nature of `order'.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD

He hands WIMBRIDGE an envelope.

</b>          Of course, sir. I will see that
          he gets it immediately...

DIDO can't help but interfere. She calls over her shoulder.

JOHN resists rolling his eyes - ghastly female!

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Yes, of course...thank you.
He backs away. DIDO still shows him nothing but her back.

He moves off, and is gone as DIDO finally turns, stares at
the closed door, flushed.

     A single figure - at the farthest end of the crimson
     drawing room...DIDO'S heart skips a beat at the SOUND of
     the approaching dinner party...Suddenly the doors open
     ...DIDO stands quickly - nervous.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD

               rumours when you were spreading
               them?
     DIDO curtseys respectfully to LORD MANSFIELD.
<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               May I present to you the second

     DIDO curtseys. LADY ASHFORD nods graciously. OLIVER bows -
     has to nudge his troubled brother do the same.

<b>                         OLIVER
</b>               A pleasure, Miss Lindsay.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>                   (sotto - re. James)
               He is the eldest - to inherit the
               entire Ashford fortune. He is
               also to inherit from his uncle -
               a healthy man, who shows little
               sign of departure.

<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          Lady Ashford herself. She seems
          rather despondent at her
          brother's robust constitution.

JAMES catches DIDO'S soft brown eyes resting on him.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          He has much to recommend him. And
          a second fortune in life should

ELIZABETH clocks the gaze between DIDO and JAMES.
<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          Dido! You are not to be a
          coquette with him! You already

          society think of us!
OLIVER moves to his brother, follows his gaze to DIDO.
<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          She is intriguing, is she not?

<b>                    JAMES
</b>          I find her repulsive.
<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          I suppose she is...if you find a
          most rare and exotic flower so.
          She is quite something to behold.

ON DIDO as she falters under the brothers' stares.
<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>              (flustered, to DIDO)
          Good Lord! They are appraising me!
ELIZABETH composes herself. JAMES' eyes remain on DIDO,
swallowing hard at her undeniable beauty.

<b>                    JAMES
</b>          One does not make a wife of the
          rare and exotic, Oliver. One

          of the Indies...

     OLIVER offers DIDO a discreet smile, as she sits beside

ON LADY ASHFORD as she studies DIDO. ELIZABETH finishes,
amid a smattering of polite applause led by JAMES.

<b>                    OLIVER (CONT'D)
</b>          And what of you Miss Lindsay?
          Are we to hear you play tonight?

DIDO looks up to find OLIVER smiling across at her.

LORD MANSFIELD hesitates. DIDO is embarrassed.

<b>                    OLIVER
</b>          Oh do not be selfish with your
          good fortune, m'lord!
A beat...then put on the spot, LORD MANSFIELD caves,
throwing up his hands, helplessly.

DIDO is tentative, ELIZABETH less pleased.
<b>                    LADY ASHFORD
</b>          This will be most interesting!
DIDO moves to the pianoforte settles her fingers on the
keys. A beat, then Handel's Suite No.9 fills the room.

LORD MANSFIELD closes his eyes, irritated with himself.
LADY MARY whispers to LADY MANSFIELD.
<b>                    LADY MARY
</b>          She has never played in company!
LADY MANSFIELD is silent - stiff with anxiety.

DIDO is raising a beautiful and fluent sound - as skillful
as the most gifted of Georgian young ladies.
LORD MANSFIELD'S eyes spring open - sees all held hostage.
OLIVER moves forward, utterly fascinated.
Relief floods LADY MANSFIELD - she sighs with pride as LADY
MARY lends LADY ASHFORD a smug look.

     Echoing footsteps. LORD and LADY MANSFIELD move toward
     their rooms, each with a lamp to light their way.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               She has no reason. Hers is an

     An UNFAMILIAR FACE mixing paints, engrossed. His weather-

LORD MANSFIELD laughs at him. DIDO stares at the ground -
cringing on JOHN'S behalf. John asserts himself.
<b>                    JOHN
</b>          One day...yes...m'lord. I wish to

     A beat. His words force DIDO to look up, affected.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               Noble if not pompous! A country
               lawyer, you may make - perhaps! If
               you pay every regard to what you
               are taught - but you have neither
               the rank nor finances for any more!

<b>                         JOHN
</b>               Well...as a fourth son, you had
               rank but not the income to pay for
               your qualification to the Inns.

     DIDO's wide eyes take in JOHN, astonished by his chuzpah.
<b>                         JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>               Without the sponsorship of Lord

               your capabilities?

               considerations...but I know a
               country life does not suit me.

     LORD MANSFIELD's gaze is trained on JOHN. DIDO has finished
     gathering the books and is quietly slipping from the room.

She slows, caught by one of the paintings - an English rose
stares out, as a black domestic submissively fastens a
priceless bracelet around her lady-master's wrist.
DIDO's POV: CLOSE on the domestic. Suddenly...
<b>                    JOHN

DIDO flushes.

DIDO hesitates, tentative.

          drowned.

              (hesitant)
          Drowned - by the crew on the

JOHN watches as DIDO falters.

<b>                       DIDO
</b>          But...why?

The SOUND of the MANSFIELDS gathering with the ASHFORDS. A
maid approaches hurrying about her duties.

</b>          Thank you.
JOHN hesitates, struck with confusion at the maid's words.
DIDO becomes awkward. LADY MANSFIELD emerges, disappearing
into the dining room.
<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          Mr Davinier, will you be joining
          us for dinner?
JOHN's eyes dart to DIDO - sees her unease. It pierces him.
<b>                                                                  29.

     DIDO steps into the room, expressionless. She sits on the
     chaise longue, allows her gaze to settle on her reflection.

     Something terrible resonates through her - some awful
     thought or feeling, that leaves her breathless with
     emotion. And then her fingers come up to the skin on her
     chest...and she begins to pinch and pull with self-hatred,
     rubbing the heel of her palm across her cheek, her
     forehead, as her face crumples and she begins to cry.

               There is much speculation on your
               decision. Anticipation seems to
               be turning to panic, m'lord.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD

               Indies. Your ruling could bring
               the slave trade to its knees -
               entirely destroy an economic
               foundation of these lands.

               Is that pressure not maddening,

     LORD MANSFIELD reigns in his horse. He quotes in Latin.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>               But...is that where it hinges?

               financial ruin - or claim your
               due from the insurers.

Her eyes hone in on a pamphlet under his arm. JOHN shifts
uneasy at what it shows - the last few letters of THE ZONG
can be seen, and LORD MANSFIELD depicted with large butt.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          I appear the only one to have
          just learned of this affair?

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Perhaps yours is a life less
          concerned with such matters.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Why do you judge me so?
He studies her. She is tentative.

<b>                    DIDO (CONT'D)
</b>          It is a fact that I have
          contemplated on the matter for
          many hours, and I...I do not
          think the slaves could have been
          drowned in the way you say.

ON his disbelief - irritation slowly turns to dawning.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Are you at utter disconnect from
          everything?!
He searches her, making her feel very small and ashamed. As
he moves off, she stares after him, distressed.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Mr Davinier...please. Tell me.

</b>              (earnest)
          Do not render me your amusement.
He traces her vulnerability. It roots him.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          I can only tell you what I believe.

          chained together as one.

               The captain hoped it would `pay'
               to kill them.
     ON DIDO as colour drains from her face.   Nausea rises...

     His eyes try to read hers, becoming sensitive. As he moves
     back towards her. She struggles to take it in.
<b>                         JOHN (CONT'D)

<b>                         DIDO
</b>               But the insurers are appealing.

<b>                         JOHN
</b>               Yes. They are challenging the
               decision of the lower court -
               refusing to pay for murdered
               slaves.

     Her eyes sting. JOHN can see she is having difficulty - he
     touches her hand absentmindedly, startling her, but their
     eyes remain locked. She attempts, weakly, to return self-
     possession. Then almost a whisper...

<b>                            DIDO
</b>               Thank you.

     That is, thank you for telling me what nobody else has!

     She turns, walks away.    ON DIDO, as her pace quickens.

     She moves to a desk, pulls open drawers - REVEAL volumes
     and volumes of news pamphlets. A set of them bound, LORD
     MANSFIELD'S wax seal hanging from the cord. She unties the
     cord, wax seal all over her hands. She fingers her way
     through the pile - legal headlines...all referring to Lord
     Mansfield. She stops dead...

     POV - pamphlet cover...image of LORD MANSFIELD, drooping
     bottom lip touching the ground - foolish and dithering,
     whilst beside him a `Negro' slave wields a judge's' gavel.

     She runs her fingers across the caricature, pained - then
     moves urgently to the next pamphlet, and the next...
     More MANSFIELD caricatures - a big nose, fat lips, all with
     Zong headlines:'Mansfield to Rule on "Disposable Slaves" `

ELIZABETH is knelt at the pond's edge with JAMES - a paper
boat floats on the water, toppling over to a unanimous cry.

OLIVER watches as DIDO approaches. His eyes light up.
<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          Oh Dido look - Mr James has made

JAMES stretches a branch into the lake to rescue the boat.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          What a dreadful shame.

OLIVER collects paper from the grass. CLOSE on his hands as
he folds it into a boat under DIDO'S nose.
<b>                    OLIVER
</b>              (to DIDO, earnest)

<b>                       DIDO
</b>          Thank you.

afar, LADY MANSFIELD watches.

</b>               What is that to mean Mr James?

</b>               That he should compromise a
               lady's reputation by stepping out

</b>               I think you are a great deal too
               anxious, brother. We should merely
               take a turn around Vauxhall.
     DIDO observes JAMES - His protestation is bitter. She
     traces OLIVER'S features, warmly.
<b>                         DIDO
</b>               I should be delighted, Mr Oliver!

<b>                     OLIVER

          when your better half has equipped
          you so well with loveliness and

Dido is stung. OLIVER shrugs, oblivious. The sound of Handel
filters from a nearby concert. DIDO tries hard to recover.

LADY MANSFIELD and LADY MARY exchange a look. LADY MARY is
somehow softened - her eyes appeal to LADY MANSFIELD...

He chuckles, brings his hand up to brush her cheek, gently.
She smiles just as her eyes fall on the back of a gentleman's
head, shoulders - his movement somehow familiar.
The sight roots her, uncertain of what she sees. And then
he turns to address another, and his profile becomes clear.

It is JOHN DAVINIER.
In that moment, he flicks his head round and his gaze falls
on her - a beat between them then his eyes fall on OLIVER.
JOHN excuses himself from others and makes his way across.

His eyes soften as he looks at her...

<b>                    JOHN

          were he to know of us speaking.
DIDO tugs him into a quiet lane, away from the concert and
promenading.

Hardly a breath and BAM!! She is slammed against a walled
maze, suddenly!! JOHN pressed against her tightly!
Confused, her gaze darts around her, finds LADY MANSFIELD
and LADY ASHFORD ambling past along a cross path, oblivious.
DIDO freezes - held tightly against JOHN. She stares
panicked into his eyes and he into hers.

61.5:CUTAWAY So they do not see ELIZABETH as she strolls by
with JAMES - Her gaze falling on JOHN and DIDO, instantly.

ELIZABETH is stunned!!!! But doesn't falter.
61.4 CONT'D: As DIDO and JOHN look back - nothing but
anonymous strangers, leaving them none the wiser to being
discovered. JOHN pulls away, embarrassed...
<b>                    JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>          Forgive me.
She nods, equally bashful. They regard each other.

<b>                    DIDO

          Mr Davinier?
<b>                    JOHN
</b>          I am under a third cousin - a

          than petty disputes between
          unsavoury landlords and debauched
          tenants, but I cannot discount it.

</b>          Not what you wished for.

DIDO is unexpectedly struck - recovers herself.

<b>                    DIDO

          Tis pitiful! Such inability to
          simply know what value to put on
          another's life.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>              (bitterly)
          What price, a worthless Negro.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>              (frustrated)
          You utterly misunderstand me.
          I am saying that no man may have
          the value of that of cargo!!!
          Human beings cannot be priced,
          since we are priceless!! Freemen
          and slaves alike!
Her eyes begin to sting at the `integrity' in his words.
<b>                    JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>              (enthused)
          I am with others here. We are
          all students in law - applying
          pressure on the insurance companies
          to refuse from here on to insure
          slaves on any ship. A simple clause.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          But that would require a change
          of law. I know nothing but...

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          A change in law - something the
          insurance companies can lobby for
          IF they can be persuaded to band
          together.
              (softly,)
          We may only be students,
          but...change is most always
          precipitated by the young.

          Someone has to have the courage.
          How can we expect to be civilised
          if we live in a barbaric world.
His words wind her as JOHN shakes his head, frustrated. She
takes him in - he is so very handsome!

DIDO stares at him earnestly.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          No. It is more than that. It's
          the shame of a law that would
          uphold a financial transaction
          upon that atrocity.
She is scathing and accepting all at once, affecting him.
<b>                    JOHN
</b>          That is indeed the truth.

Their eyes are locked. An intimate beat that perturbs her.

          like you.

He is emotional, it perturbs him too, now.

          anxious. Should I follow to see
          you safely.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          No we cannot risk it.
He nods - studies her....

OLIVER studies her - she is so nervous...what is she
hiding? A moment - then his eyes become forgiving.

     LORD MANSFIELD moves through hallways, robed, wigged, his
     full authority apparent. LORD ASHFORD walks beside him.
<b>                         LORD ASHFORD
</b>               I had the pleasure of laying eyes
               on your adopted girl.
<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>                   (facetious)
               Which one?
<b>                         LORD ASHFORD
</b>               You have raised a lovely young
               lady...And, though I understand she
               is kept under interesting rules,
               She raises questions.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               Spit it out.
<b>                         LORD ASHFORD
</b>               Her introduction to society comes
               at a key time in the insurance
               appeal. Parliament is nervous that
               your `family situation' will
               colour your judgement.
<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               I will neither be pressured from
               the inside - or the outside.
     LORD ASHFORD comes to a stop.

<b>                          LORD ASHFORD
</b>                   (calm)
               You are the highest judge in the
               land.
<b>                          (MORE)
</b><b>                                                       59.
</b>
<b>                    LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)
</b>          In you, they see a man who is of
          the persuasion and position to
          bring down the major trade of our
          time and the commercial health of
          this country. Some will say, next
          to our king, you are the most
          powerful man in England. And the
          same will ask how you, our Chief
          Justice can be fair?

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          How? RULES are in place to
          dictate how we live - were that
          not the case, I would not have
          had the mandate to give shelter
          to my nephew's child.

He struggles with his emotion.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          She is his blood - MINE! And
          rightfully had entitlement to
          grow up on the family estate.
              (aggrieved)
          The parliamentarians may challenge
          me - let them! I can tell you all,
          if the law supports the Zong's
          slave owners as strongly as Murray
          blood runs through Dido Belle's
          veins - make no mistake - the
          insurers will be forced to pay up!

LORD ASHFORD is affected. He regards LORD MANSFIELD.

<b>                    LORD ASHFORD
</b>              (softly)
          I believe you.
He raises an eyebrow. Then...

<b>                    LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)
</b>          I have reason to speak with you
          on another matter.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          Oh?
<b>                    LORD ASHFORD
</b>              (tentative)
          I have a wish to seal the bond
          between the Ashford and Mansfield
          names. It would, however, require
          some relaxing of your most
          stringent rules, I must add!
LORD MANSFIELD comes to a halt again.
<b>                                                                60.

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               Is that so?

</b>
     LORD MANSFIELD steps into the room. LADY MANSFIELD turns
     from the window. They lock gaze in a grave moment.
<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               I have had reason to speak with
               Lord Ashford.
<b>                          LADY MANSFIELD
</b>               And I to Lady Ashford.
                   (beat)
               Are we in agreement?

<b>                         LORD MANSFIELD
</b>               We are.
                   (long beat)
               You once asked me, who would
               look after her when we are gone.
               Money is no substitute for a
               man's protection. I cannot deny
               her a match so suitable.

     LADY MANSFIELD nods, satisfied.


<b>68   INT. BLOOMSBURY SQ. MARBLE ROOM. DAY. 14                   68    *
</b>     The girls are embroidering with LADY MARY. MABEL enters.
<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>               Whatever did happen in the end,
               Aunt Mary? With your gentleman
               friend.
     LADY MARY looks up surprised DIDO studies her curious.

<b>                         LADY MARY
</b>               He never married. Cousin Marjorie
               wrote me last year, that he had
               died after a long illness.

     She looks down and continues to sew. DIDO fights tears,
     unexpectedly affected. ELIZABETH takes her Aunt's hand.

<b>                         ELIZABETH

     DIDO and ELIZABETH look back at her, then at each other.

     As DIDO enters, OLIVER stands with LADY MANSFIELD, both
     fixed on her. LADY MANSFIELD takes DIDO'S hand, gently.
<b>                         LADY MANSFIELD
</b>               You need worry about nothing.
               Your Papaa has been dealt with.
     She disappears, leaving DIDO lost. A nervous silence.

<b>                         OLIVER
</b>               Hello, Miss Lindsay.
<b>                            DIDO
</b>               Mr Oliver.

               here will bring you as much
               happiness as it brings me.
     DIDO swallows hard.
     In the CORRIDORS - LADIES MANSFIELD and MARY listen through
     a crack in the doorway.

     In the DRAWING ROOM - OLIVER moves closer to DIDO.
<b>                         OLIVER (CONT'D)
</b>               I think...well, I know...that we
               make a rather good match.
                   (he pauses)
               Father has purchased me a
               commission in the navy - as
               colonel - Is that not the rank
               your blood father first purchased?
<b>                         DIDO
</b>                   (anxious)
               Yes. Indeed it is.

<b>                         OLIVER
</b>               So I feel my career is now set.
               All that remains...
     A long beat. OLIVER gathers his courage...
<b>                                                            62.
</b>

<b>                    OLIVER (CONT'D)
</b>          I can not offer you a title, Miss
          Lindsay..for the next `Lady
          Ashford'...well that title must
          fall to my brother's wife...
              (huge,nervous breath)
          What I am trying to say is, I can
          without doubt, offer you ALL that
          is due to `Mrs Oliver Ashford'
          and...and I trust that this would
          be acceptable to you.
              (he hesitates)
          Since...it would very much be my
          privilege...my honour, if you
          would agree to become my wife.
He takes something from his top pocket. DIDO looks down,
finds a large black sapphire glistening in his fingers...
In the CORRIDORS.

</b>          What are you doing?
<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          Quiet, Elizabeth!
In the DRAWING ROOM - DIDO is still staring at the ring.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Good Lord, Mr Oliver! Your
          ...your wife? Mrs Ashford?!

She repeats the title and conflict washes over her.
<b>                       DIDO (CONT'D)

          I cannot...think of anything

</b>                 Dido...was there any message
                 for me?

She hands one to JOHN, smoothing the other on her lap.
<b>                    DIDO (CONT'D)

</b>          Papaa's notes on the ship's log.
          It seems the First Mate has come
          forward with it - one Mr Stubbs. I
          could not find the log itself, but
          look at Papaa's markings - See the
          map positions - From December

JOHN'S gaze darts from notes to the map, absorbed.
<b>                    JOHN
</b>          This...This is remarkable.
He looks up from the papers.   DIDO is still tentative.

<b>                    DIDO

passing in another.

A slender, dapper gent moves towards us on the river bank.
<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD

ELIZABETH curtseys.

<b>                    ELIZABETH

She looks to her mother, stunned, his gaze follows...

<b>                    MR VAUGHAN
</b>          With her Ladyship's permission?
<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          I shall make arrangements.
ON DIDO, as OLIVER chats to others. She moves past as...

<b>                    LADY ASHFORD
</b>          A pity Lady Mansfield and I could not
          do business on James and Miss Murray.

<b>                    LADY MARY
</b>          A greater pity you rejected her.

<b>                    LADY ASHFORD
</b>          Let us not dwell on the
          unfortunate. Oliver and Miss
          Lindsay are a blissful match.
          Tell me, when exactly does she
          receive her inheritance?
As DIDO observes her reflection in waters - easy laughter
floats by - a group of gentleman josh.

A figure beside her turns - icy blue stare takes her in as
she meets his gaze and finds herself staring into the eyes
of JAMES ASHFORD.
<b>                    JAMES ASHFORD.
</b>          Miss Lindsay. Not Husband
          hunting, are we?
              (off Dido's disdain)
          Good Lord, I forgot - you have
          ensnared my brother. Now is he to
          share his dining room with you, as
          well as his bed??
His words bury deep and painful.

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Oh, Mr James, your manners are as
          poor as your brother's finances.

<b>                    JAMES
</b>          And you are foolish enough to marry
          him. I on the other have no better

          make for rather amusing sport!

</b>

She follows his gaze through trees to ELIZABETH breathing
in the scent of the azaleas beside MR VAUGHAN. The joshing
gentlemen trickle away leaving only DIDO and JAMES.
She goes to move off. JAMES grabs her arm, spitefully.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          That is painful, sir.
<b>                    JAMES

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          It is not in my repertoire to
          keep company with beasts.

He regards her - her disdain reflected in his eyes. His
free hand comes up, fingers rest on her lips, then spread,
as he crushes her beauty in his hand.
Her eyes fill as he brings her close. So close. She is
afraid, angry. She struggles desperately, spirited, both
arousing and alarming him. As she tears herself from him

<b>                    DIDO (CONT'D)
</b>          How dare you? HOW DARE YOU!

He stares at her - takes her in, calmly. Then...
<b>                       JAMES
</b>          With ease.

DIDO wavers nauseous with contempt.   JAMES moves off.   She
watches, incensed, humiliated.

ELIZABETH strolls with MR VAUGHAN, as JAMES passes OLIVER,
he whispers to his brother.

<b>                    JAMES (CONT'D)
</b>          You will destroy us. You will destroy
          the entire order of our family.
Nearby, DIDO emerges from the trees...
<b>                    LADY ASHFORD
</b>          Oliver has been searching for you!

LADY MANSFIELD notes DIDO'S odd demeanour, LADY MARY too.
Her eyes dart suspiciously to JAMES as he approaches.
<b>                    LADY MANSFIELD
</b>          Are you unwell, my dear?
DIDO's affected eyes come up to meet her mother's. She goes
to answer...interrupted as...ELIZABETH gasps overwhelmed...

<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          Oh!..Mr James!

     A distressed DIDO follows her gaze back to JAMES.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>               Lady Ashford, you had not mentioned
               Mr James was to attend!
<b>                         LADY ASHFORD
</b>               Surprisingly.

     LADY ASHFORD closes her eyes,livid. VAUGHAN stands usurped.

</b>               Ladies.
                   (off Dido's reaction)
               Miss Murray.

     He kisses ELIZABETH'S hand oh so gently, for DIDO'S
     benefit. LADY MANSFIELD's heart sinks.
     OFF DIDO, turbulent.

               I am not certain he is ready to
               go against the traders - they are

      follows his gaze, to DIDO alone in the gardens, reading.

      POV: THROUGH THE WINDOW, as DIDO feels their gaze. She
      falters. Her eyes dart through the glass, beyond LORD
      MANSFIELD, to the canvas....The sight causes her to stand -
      drawn to the window to see more clearly.

              (steely eyed)
          Let me be clear, loss of water on a
          ship constitutes a singularly

          law is transparent and equivocal -
          the jettisoning of enslaved cargo
          ...IS legal!
              (he spells it out)
          And in these circumstances, combined
          with unavoidable loss of water, our

</b>          The ship's owners chose a tight
          `packing fashion' to transport
          the slaves...A popular fashion of
          transportation that is known for
          causing death and disease.

His voice is raised over the sounds of a chaotic court.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          This choice of laying the slaves
          tightly together is undertaken at
          the Captain's own risk. In the
          event that over packing renders
          an avoidable lack of drinking water
          on board a protracted journey,
          such a decision may be viewed as
          simple `bad management' on a
<b>                    (MORE)
</b><b>                                                             98.
</b>
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          Captain's part, and further, weigh
          as his own risk. An extended journey
          - one in which the destination is
          overshot may also be viewed as
          the captain's own mismanagement.
The noise lowers to silence. LORD MANSFIELD settles on JOHN.

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          It is not legal...to discharge lives
          from a ship into the waters, to
          prevent those lives dying on land,
          and to facilitate insurance
          compensation. Whether they be the
          lives of horses... or human beings
          ...slaves or otherwise - It is
          not legal, neither is it right.

DIDO lets out a gasp - breathless relief.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          Further, the claim of shortage of
          water is illegitimate shown by the
          evidence put forward. To my
          mind, it is clear a fraud has been
          committed in claiming insurance on
          slaves who were...drowned solely
          for financial gain.
He looks around the room - sees LORD ASHFORD's acceptance.
His eyes fall on DIDO now and here they remain.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          It is my opinion, that the state of
          slavery is so odious a position that
          nothing may support it. This case
          has displayed with searing clarity
          the depravity of any such nation
          whose choice is to practice it. You
          may be certain that I have laboured
          over my judgement and statements
          today and am in full understanding
          of all of the ramifications. Justice
          be done,though the heavens may fall.
JOHN'S eyes brim at the realisation of those words.

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>          I find in favour of the insurers
          and overturn the decision of the
          lower court. I order a retrial.

Stunned confusion in the courtroom. Then, all kinds of
commotion - anger, cheers amid shock. LORD MANSFIELD stands.

<b>                      CLERK
</b>          All rise!
<b>                                                                   99.
</b>

      JOHN jumps up, desperate for eye contact through the
      commotion...but LORD MANSFIELD fixes ahead, moves off.
      DIDO stands, caught by her own breath. JOHN turns to her.
      She begins to sob. For the first time he pulls her close,

      WIDE on the court room - JOHN holding DIDO as she sobs.
      Through the judges' exit - a figure, in the shadows. REVEAL
      LORD MANSFIELD, taking in DIDO and JOHN, affected.


<b>124   EXT. WESTMINSTER HALL. STREETS - DAY.26                      124   *
</b>      JOHN watches as DIDO races back to the carriage. ON their
      reaction - LORD MANSFIELD stands waiting.
      As DIDO and LORD MANSFIELD come before each other. Everything
      in their eyes - restrained emotion over a long beat.
<b>                          DIDO
</b>                You may not blame Mr Davinier
                ...My attendance today is
                absolutely at my own volition
                ...for matters which concern me.

<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>                I am fully aware, Dido.

      He fixes on JOHN. JOHN is apprehensive.
<b>                          JOHN
</b>                M'Lord...I am inspired by your
                decision today. We will not go
                backwards from here.
<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>                    (burdened)
                History will judge if your
                optimism is warranted...(beat)...
                You are a man of conviction.

      JOHN swallows hard, emotion rising, stinging his eyes.
<b>                          JOHN
</b>                I am trying to be.
<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD
</b>                Then your efforts are not in vain.

      DIDO moves to JOHN'S side, taking his hand. LORD
      MANSFIELD's eyes drop to their clasped fingers.

<b>                          LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)
</b>                I have not changed my mind. She
                is to marry a gentleman.
      He turns and begins to move to the carriage.   JOHN stares
      at the ground, humiliated. DIDO is incensed.
<b>                                                             100.
</b>

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          And Mr Davinier is not a gentleman?
Her voice rings out, furious. LORD MANSFIELD stops...

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          He is...indeed...Dido.
              (he speaks carefully)
          And that is why he ought to have
          a job befitting one.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>              (a whisper - defiant)
          My affections are with him, Papaa.
          I wish for nothing...
          nothing, if not to be his wife.

She stares into LORD MANSFIELD's eyes - he takes in JOHN.
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          If you would Mr Davinier, I would
          like you to attend my chambers in
          the morning. There are matters I
          would like you to assist me with.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          Your Lordship?
<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          And if you think it a good
          idea...I wish to facilitate
          your entry to the Inns of Court.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>              (tentative)
          That is to serve my qualification
          to The Bar?
The question LORD MANSFIELD once put to JOHN, is now answered.

<b>                    LORD MANSFIELD
</b>          Indeed...(humbled)...Capabilities
          such as yours are clearly
          deserving of such considerations.
JOHN breathes heavily, also humbled, as his tears surface.

<b>                    JOHN
</b>          I..I think it a very good idea, sir.

LORD MANSFIELD nods, then finally moves off.    JOHN can't
take it in. DIDO is breathless, eyes brim...
<b>                    JOHN (CONT'D)
</b>          Can it be true?
<b>                                                            101.
</b>

<b>                    DIDO
</b>          Of course. He sees what I see.
          His words were as clear as...
<b>                    JOHN
</b>          No! That your feelings for me are
          so? That you would be my wife..?
              (off her reaction, )
          Because, I cannot conceive of a
          life without you...and if...if
          such were all that were before
          me, Miss Lindsay, then my heart
          would never beat the same again.
<b>                    DIDO
</b>          It is not. It is not all that is
          before you Mr Davinier...
          (begins sobbing) I love you...for
          all that you are, and with
          all..all that I am.

He breaks down now too, wiping her tears before kissing her
through his own sobs. Then tears turn to laughter.

We draw back on the couple - two fragile figures, amid the
bustle of London town.
ON the MANSFIELD crest as LORD MANSFIELD'S carriage moves
off, a solitary figure inside, staring straight ahead.
