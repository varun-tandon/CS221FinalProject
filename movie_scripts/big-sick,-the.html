</b>              Hello. I grew up in Pakistan. And people
              are always asking me, what was that like?
              Really not that different from here. I
              mean we played cricket, which is just a
              spicier version of baseball. And we
              prayed a lot. Well not a lot, just five
              times a day. And we marry someone our
              parents find for us. Arranged marriage,
              you know. For me, it was probably that we
              got episodes of the A-Team a little bit
              later. And by a little bit later, I mean
              we just got episode two. But other than
              that, it was exactly the same.

    Kumail walks into the comedy club as MARY is doing a set
    on stage. CHRIS intercepts Kumail as he walks backstage.

<b>                           CHRIS
</b>              There's no bad crowds dude. Only bad
              comedians.

<b>                           KUMAIL
</b>              You complain about the crowd like all
              the time.

<b>                           CHRIS
</b>              Yeah, but that's when they're really bad.

<b>                           KUMAIL
</b>              So like ninety percent of the time,
              they're really bad?

              tonight? If we both give each other
              notes, I think it would be helpful.

<b>                           KUMAIL
</b>              Your notes are just to add more "fucks"
              into the bit.

</b>              Fuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and

    Mary walks off the stage and sits on the couch next to

</b>
<b>                           MARY
</b>              That was truly horrible.

              Tuesday! Whooo!! And we all know what
              happens after eight Jell-o shots. We
              urinate all over ourselves and puke.
              Okay, so I'm going to bring up the next
              comic. You know this man.

    Chris slaps his own face.

    Chris walks on stage.

<b>                           KUMAIL
</b>              He's like if a serial killer fucked an

<b>                           CJ
</b>              He's like Daniel Day Lewis except he

<b>                           DODD

</b>              Okay. Cool.



<b>    INT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER
</b>
    CJ is on stage crushing it. Kumail and Mary watch from
    the wings.

<b>                           CJ
</b>              I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was
              trying to mansplain to her that, you
              know, we are on one little rock orbiting
              a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in
              a universe full of a billion galaxies, so
              I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit?
              You are cosmically over reacting to this.
              Honestly you are being super selfish.
              You're right, but you're selfish.

    Kumail looks out at the crowd. Dalavan enjoys CJ's set.



<b>    INT. TRIPLE DOOR - LATER
</b>
    Kumail puts a RECORDER on his stool, presses RECORD and
    starts his set.

<b>                           KUMAIL
</b>              Hey! Have you guys heard of this new drug
              cocktail called cheese? I saw these news
              reports so I looked up what cheese is and
              cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM
              and heroin. So really, it's heroin.
              Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do
              the heroin, it's very powerful. You
              already have heroin.

    Kumail looks to see if Bob Dalavan is laughing. He's not
    there. He's in the back talking to CJ. Fuck.

    O.S. A WOMAN "Woo-hoos!" Kumail looks out at the crowd
    and sees EMILY, late 20's, white with a streak of blue
    in her hair. She sits at a table with a few friends.

<b>                          KUMAIL (CONT'D)

    She smiles.

    Crowded bar scene after the show. Kumail, Chris, Mary
    and CJ hang out at the bar.

<b>                          CHRIS
</b>             He just gave you Montreal? Like you
             don't have to showcase or audition or
             anything?

<b>                          CJ
</b>             It was too easy. Like I wanted to
             struggle. I wanted a story to be able
             to tell on talk shows and instead,
             like, you guys don't know how hard it
             is not to struggle. It's a struggle
             succeeding effortlessly.

<b>                          MARY
</b>             Did he say anything about me?

<b>                          CJ

    Kumail walks over to Emily and her friend JESSIE, talks
    loud over the music.

<b>                          KUMAIL
</b>             Hi.

</b>

<b>                          EMILY
</b>              Hi.

<b>                           KUMAIL
</b>              Um, my name is Kumail.

<b>                           EMILY
</b>              Yeah. We know.

<b>                           JESSIE
</b>              We saw you perform.

<b>                           KUMAIL
</b>              Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of
              the way, I have to tell you that when
              you yelled at me, it threw me off. You
              really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's
              so rude.

<b>                           EMILY
</b>              I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed
              you. It was supportive.

<b>                           KUMAIL
</b>              Okay, that's a common misconception.
              Yelling anything at a comedian is
              considered heckling. Heckling doesn't
              have to be negative.

<b>                           EMILY
</b>              So if I yelled out "You're amazing in
              bed," that would be a heckle?

<b>                           KUMAIL
</b>              Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle.

<b>                           JESSIE
</b>              Wow. Goodbye!

    Jessie walks away.

<b>                           EMILY
</b>              Don't go! You scared my friend off now.

<b>                           KUMAIL

<b>                          EMILY
</b>              Emily.

<b>                           KUMAIL

</b>              Well air mattresses are actual
              mattresses. You're being bigoted towards
              air based comfort items.

              he said he doesn't smile because it
              makes his face look fat. So I didn't
              smile in pictures for many years. What

</b>              No. It's really not good. I had acne,
              and I was a Goth and I had this
              terrible perm. The kids called me
              Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually
              I do know why, it's because they
              thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I
              think I'm done with this subject. In
              fact, I think I'm gonna go home.

     Emily gets up, pulling the blanket with her to hide her

               time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna
               call an Uber and go home.

<b>                  EMILY
</b>     I'm not really - I know this sounds
     like a line - but I'm not really dating
     right now. I have a lot of school and
     work and just a lot on my plate.

<b>                  KUMAIL
</b>     That's perfect because I'm not really
     dating right now either. I actually
     have a pretty strict two-day rule where
     I can't see someone more than two days
     in a row. So since we hung out for two
     days, if I were to see you again, which
     I won't because you're not dating, I'm
     not dating, I wouldn't be able to see
     you until Monday.

<b>                  EMILY
</b>     We haven't hung out for two days. We've
     hung out for about five hours. Just to
     like, be totally clear.

<b>                  KUMAIL
</b>     Yesterday and today. Cause it's after
     midnight, today is actually tomorrow.
     Earlier tonight was yesterday. So two
     days.

<b>                  EMILY
</b>     You see, I don't date time nerds, so that
     really takes you off the table.

<b>                  KUMAIL
</b>     That works out, because I am a hard
     core time nerd.

<b>                  EMILY
</b>     Yeah, I can tell.

<b>                  KUMAIL
</b>     I'm like, very strict about AM/PM
     stuff.

<b>                  EMILY
</b>     So wait, just to establish, what did we
     just decide?

<b>                  KUMAIL

               difficult. Just observe me.

<b>                            AZMAT

<b>                            CHRIS
</b>               What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at
               the airport get a boner. Does that mean
               drugs or bombs?

<b>                            CJ
</b>               That's good. What if instead of it being
               at the airport, you quit comedy and never
               did comedy ever again?

<b>                            CHRIS

<b>                            CJ
</b>               Just for the sake of the public. So they

<b>                            CJ
</b>               He suggested it.

<b>                            KUMAIL
</b>               She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine.
               They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors
               know medical stuff. That's what doctors
               do. They're good at medical stuff. This
               is a medically induced coma. This is
               their specialty.

<b>                            MARY
</b>               Maybe.

<b>                            CHRIS
</b>               It might be a good thing. She might wake
               up with a new skill. Like my cousin
               blacked out once and when he came to, he
               thought he knew a different language.

<b>                            CJ

<b>                            CHRIS
</b>               No, it was just gibberish that he made
               up. It was brain damage.

     CJ and Mary shake their heads. Kumail looks freaked out.

<b>     INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM- MONDAY MORNING
</b>
     Terry and Beth wait. Beth is sewing a shirt of Emily's.
     Terry is pacing. Kumail walks up to them.

<b>                            KUMAIL
</b>               I know you guys said you don't need me

               wait anyway.

<b>                            BETH
</b>               You guys broke up. I'm not sure why

               about being committed to anything,
               Kumail. You didn't want to when she was
               awake. There's no need to do it when
               she's unconscious.

<b>                            KUMAIL
</b>               It's more complicated than that--

               secrets. She tells us everything.
                      (beat, then)
               You really don't have to stay Kumail. You
               have already done a lot.

     Kumail is speechless. After a beat of awkward quiet--

<b>                            KUMAIL
</b>               I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this
               seat- ?

     Kumail gestures to the empty seat next to Beth, but she
     throws her sewing on it and turns away.

     Kumail walks to another row of seats and sits down,
     facing Emily's parents. Beth watches him intensely for a
     few beats before Kumail turns to the woman sitting next
     to him.

<b>     INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA- LATER
</b>
     Kumail carries his tray, spots Terry and Beth together
     having a hushed conversation. He sits at a different
     table. Terry waves at him. Kumail heads over to them.

</b>                     (barely looks up)

     Kumail nods. Sits down. They eat. It's awkward.

<b>                            KUMAIL

<b>                            BETH

<b>                            TERRY
</b>               Mine's good. Tuna's always a gamble.
               You know, we're not by the water. Well,
               we are by the water, but it's a lake.
               There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever.
               I threw the dice. I got the 7's, I
               guess. Whatever the good dice number

               Anti. It was a tragedy.
                     (a beat)
               I mean we lost 19 of our best guys.

</b>

<b>                           KUMAIL
</b>              That was a joke, obviously. 9/11 was a
              terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to
              joke about it.

     Beth and Terry are PAGED on the intercom. They quickly
     gather up their things and get up to leave.

<b>                           KUMAIL (CONT'D)

</b>              The antibiotics aren't doing exactly
              what we'd hoped they would, and we
              don't want to mess around. So we're
              going to perform surgery tomorrow
              morning to remove the infection.

<b>                           BETH
</b>              Wait a second- Dr. Spellman told us
              that the antibiotics would work. He
              didn't say anything at all about
              surgery.

<b>                            DR. CUNNINGHAM
</b>               It's called thoracentesis, it's a very
               common procedure. We're going to go in
               between the ribs and remove the
               infection.

<b>                            DR. CUNNINGHAM

              giraffe walks into a bar and he says to
              the bartender, "Highballs on me." You
              get it, right?

</b>               He's a giraffe, he's tall, so it would
               stand to reason his testicles are high
               and a highball is a type of drink, and
               you ruined it by saying I wasn't funny
               first.

     He gives up and eats. Kumail chuckles.

<b>                            BETH
</b>               I was going to East Carolina University
               and I was waiting tables. We met at
               this coffee shop, I was waiting on him.
               I liked his hair. He was a teacher
               already. Thick New York accent like
               nobody I'd ever met. Totally wrong for
               me. So naturally we fell-in-love. My
               family could not stand him. We're all
               military people, army pilots. All my
               brothers played football. Terry
               couldn't even change a tire. My father
               got so mad he broke every dinner plate
               we had. Now back then, you go to the
               gas station, you fill up your tank, you
               get a dinner plate. But just one at a
               time. Cup, saucer. It took us a year of
               fill-ups to get the whole set back. And
               Terry just stuck around. Eventually
               they just all got over it.

<b>                            KUMAIL

</b>               I've just been through so many of these
               appointments and I never have anything in
               common with the guys. You know when girls
               at work complain about dating, I just
               want to body slam them. They have no
               idea. I don't know. My mom says I'm
               becoming the bruised apple at the bottom
               of the apple bucket.

               without our parents? Have you been to the
               cat cafe? The cats just come up to you
               and nestle in your lap and you just pet
               them.

               us to hangout again. It's not you. You're
               fantastic. I just can't do this arranged

<b>                            KHADIJA
</b>               I'm just really tired. Do you ever want
               to just be in a relationship so you can
               finally relax?

<b>                            KUMAIL
</b>               I'm sorry. You deserve better than me.

               deserve. It's bullshit. And stop being so
               sorry about everything. I'm gonna go.

              but no. She hasn't. Let me give you
              some advice Kumail. You're going to
              know the woman you want to spend the
              rest of your life with when you cheat
              on her. When you cheat on her and you
              just feel like shit.

              terrible advice.

     Terry is clearly fraught.

     Dodd runs off. On stage, Mary is doing well. Kumail's
     phone rings. It's Terry. Kumail hesitates. Then answers.
     We see Kumail's face. He doesn't say anything. On stage -
     Mary finishes her act. We hear Terry's voice on the
     call.

              all these news reports, and they were
              like, there's a new drug, it's called
              cheese. Everyone's doing it in the

               fighting. She looks like she's just
               laying there. I said horrible things to
               her. I hurt her. She loves birds. Like
               she gets excited every time she sees a
               bird. She's like, look at this, it's a
               bird. And I'm always like, yeah,
               they're all over the place, they're

</b>
     It's darker, less clinical-feeling at night in Emily's
     room. She's still the same, the beeping is the same, but
     there's something almost holy feeling in the room at

</b>
     He looks inside the room. Emily is awake, surrounded by
     her parents and some doctors. Kumail watches through the

     Kumail wants to go in but doesn't.

     Nurse Judy holds up a CUP for Emily to sip from. Emily
     spits out the liquid.

</b>               Emily has a rare condition called Adult

               still hadn't gone down even after
               several days in bed, which is strange.
               Still's disease is when the body thinks
               healthy tissue is an infection so it
               tries to fight it. It's like a big
               biological misunderstanding.

                to understand that all that happened
                while I was asleep. Like you felt one
                way a few weeks ago and now you're
                saying you feel the total opposite way
                and the only thing that's changed is
                that I was in a coma. Honestly, I look
                at all of this, and I just think, I
                can't do it again. I can't be the
                reason that you don't have a family. It

                won't let you kick me out of the
                family. Since I am a member of the
                family, it would stand to reason that I
                would get a vote in whether or not I
                get kicked out, and that vote would
                have to be unanimous. Standard
                parliamentary procedure. So all those
                in favor of not kicking Kumail out of

                you can't really kick someone out of your
                family because they'll always be your
                family." I agree with that one. It's a
                good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here
                for you.

</b>                Hi, I'm Emily.

<b>                             NAVEED
</b>                I've heard lots about you.

<b>                             EMILY
</b>                It's so good to finally meet you.
                       (to Kumail)
                There's actually something I wanted to
                tell you.

      Naveed clocks the tension between them.

<b>                             NAVEED
</b>                Okay, well I'm going to just... goodbye.

      Naveed slips out as Emily and Kumail stare at each other.

      Terry lies on the pull out sofa. Just before Beth gets
      to Emily's room she stops.

<b>                             BETH
</b>                Are you warm enough?

<b>                             TERRY
</b>                Yeah, yeah. I've got my two pairs of
                socks on.

      She smiles, walks into Emily's bedroom. Terry gets under
      the covers. Beth reemerges and approaches his couch-bed.

<b>                               BETH
</b>                Do you mind?

<b>                               TERRY
</b>                No... no...

      Beth gets under the covers with him. They snuggle.

<b>                             BETH
</b>                I'm glad we're going home tomorrow.

<b>                             TERRY
</b>                Me too. See? I should have brushed my

<b>                               BETH

      Kumail and Emily sit on the bed from his show together.


<b>                            EMILY
</b>               When something like this happens,
               there's this sort of expectation that
               you're going to have this completely
               new lease on life and feel totally
               different about everything. Like
               cherish every sunrise. And for the most
               part I just feel like, ugh I can't get
               up that early. I'm sorry, I feel like
               I've been talking about myself so much.
               Are you doing a lot of stand-up?

<b>                            KUMAIL
</b>               Yeah, I bombed my Montreal Comedy
               Festival audition, like horrifically.

<b>                            EMILY
</b>               I saw the video. It wasn't great. I'll be
               honest with you, it wasn't great.

<b>                            KUMAIL
</b>               I know.

<b>                            EMILY
</b>               But there was a lot I liked. Like a lot I
               liked.

<b>                            KUMAIL
</b>               I'm moving to New York.

<b>                            EMILY
</b>               Really?

<b>                            KUMAIL
</b>               Yeah. Mary and CJ and I are just gonna
               drive out. We have a place already.

<b>                            EMILY

<b>                            KUMAIL
</b>               Next weekend.

      This kinda hits them both like a ton of bricks.

<b>                            EMILY
</b>               I'm so excited for you. That is great.
               I think you are going to do so great in
               New York.

</b>                You said you were going to say something
                to me. What was it?

<b>                             EMILY
</b>                Oh, just that I wanted to thank you. My
                parents told me everything you did for me
                and I feel like the last time we spoke I
                didn't properly thank you so-

<b>                             KUMAIL
</b>                Oh yeah. Totally fine.

<b>                             EMILY
</b>                I should probably go.

<b>                             KUMAIL
</b>                Do you wanna call an Uber?

<b>                             EMILY
</b>                No, I'm gonna walk actually. This has

      They smile at each other.

</b>               Come here, you big dummy.

      Chris hugs Mary. Kumail is distracted as a CAR pulls up
      nearby. Kumail stares at it. After a beat, Kumail's dad
      Azmat pops out and walks up to Kumail.

<b>                            AZMAT
</b>               You are still kicked out of the family,
               but because we did not get a proper
               chance to say bye to you... Your mother
               is so angry with you. She is not going
               to get out of the car. She's not even
               going to look at you. And I don't
               believe you kept so much secret from
               me, your father.

<b>                              KUMAIL
</b>               I'm sorry.

<b>                            AZMAT
</b>               Here. She asked me to give this to you.

      Azmat hands Kumail a TUPPERWARE CONTAINER.

<b>                            AZMAT (CONT'D)

               with extra potatoes.

<b>                            KUMAIL
</b>               Thank you Ma.

      Kumail looks to the car. Sharmeen is in the backseat.
      She averts her gaze when she sees him looking at her.

<b>                              KUMAIL (CONT'D)
</b>               Is she okay?

<b>                            AZMAT

<b>                            AZMAT
</b>               I am forbidden from hugging you. So. It
               was nice to have you as my son. Goodbye
               forever. And do me a favor, when you
               reach New York, just text us and tell
               us that you've reached safely, okay?

      Kumail nods.

<b>                             KUMAIL
</b>                Dad, can I ask you something? When you
                and Mom went on your first date, what
                movie did you see?

<b>                             AZMAT
</b>                      (thinks, then)

      Azmat hums a snippet of a song from the movie.

<b>                             AZMAT (CONT'D)
</b>                Her favorite song. Why are you asking?

<b>                             KUMAIL
</b>                Just curious.

      Azmat nods and heads back to the car. He gets in and
      drives off. Kumail gets in the car with CJ and Mary and
      they drive off.

<b>                             KUMAIL
</b>                So the first time I came to America, I
                was fourteen and I was just visiting my
                uncle in New York and it just happened
                to be Thanksgiving. On my first day in
                America, my uncle took me to the Macy's
                Thanksgiving Day Parade and I was like,
                this is every day in America! As
                advertised. Every day they have a party
                celebrating Garfield. No day has lived
                up to that day. So I was lying to my
                parents, I was telling them I was gonna
                be a lawyer. And they're very
                disappointed cause they wanted me to be
                a doctor. And you guys are like, why
                didn't you just tell them that you
                wanted to be a doctor?

<b>                            KUMAIL (CONT'D)
</b>               It's a lie anyway. And I'm like, well it
               has to be believable. If I told them I
               want to be a doctor, they'd be like,
               "bullshit." If I say lawyer, they're
               like, "oh, ok, that's something." Cause
               there's a strict hierarchy: doctor,
               engineer, lawyer, hundreds of jobs,
               ISIS, then comedian.

      A very loud WHOOOOO emanates from the crowd. Kumail
      looks out to the crowd to see Emily, beaming at him. He
      is taken aback.

<b>                            EMILY
</b>               Oh that wasn't a heckle. I just kind of
               woo-hooed you.

<b>                            KUMAIL
</b>               Well see that's a common misconception.
               Heckling doesn't have to be negative.

<b>                            EMILY
