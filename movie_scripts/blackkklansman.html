                       since they hate us, we hate
                       ourselves. You dig Tarzan? I remember
                       that when I was a Boy I used to go
                       see Tarzan Movies on Saturdays. I
                       loved me some Jane too. Jane was A
                       Fine White Woman. White Tarzan used
                       to Beat up The Black Natives. I would
                       sit there yelling "Kill The Beasts,
                       Kill The Savages, Kill 'Em!" Actually
                       I was saying: "Kill Me." It was as if
                       a Jewish Boy watched Nazis taking
                       Jews off to Concentration Camps and
                       cheered them on. Today, I want The
                       Chief to beat The Hell out of Tarzan
                       and send him back to The Caves of
                       Europe. But it takes time to become
                       Free of The Lies and their shaming
                       effect on Black Minds. It takes time
                       to reject the most Important Lie:
                       that Black People inherently can't do
                       the same things White People can do

                          a reason for Killing The Cop. When

          Ron reflects as he feeds Investigation documents in a
          Shredder. The documents shred into pieces. Just then, the
          Undercover Phone Line rings on Ron's desk.
                         
          Ron stares at the Phone, still ringing. He looks at The
          Documents in his hand, about to feed them into The Shredder.
          Ron stops. Throws The Documents in a Folder. Sweeps some
          Folders into his Briefcase. Leaves as The Phone still rings.
