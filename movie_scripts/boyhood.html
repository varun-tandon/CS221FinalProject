<b>EXT.   OUTSIDE SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
MASON waits outside his elementary school, laying in the
grass staring up at the clouds. In the distance, the school
door opens and Mason's MOM, Olivia, walks toward him.

<b>                         MOM
</b>             Hey, love bug. You ready?

He is quickly on his feet and they are walking toward the
car.

<b>                            MASON
</b>             Yeah.     Hey, guess what, Mom?

<b>                            MOM
</b>             What?

<b>                         MASON
</b>             I figured out where wasps come from.

<b>                           MOM
</b>             Oh, yeah?    Where?

<b>                         MASON
</b>             Well, I think it must be if you flick
             a rock into the air just right, it'll
             turn into a wasp.

<b>                            MOM
</b>             Dang...

<b>                            MASON
</b>             Yep.

<b>                            MOM
</b>             That's cool.

<b>INT. CAR - DAY
</b>
Driving...

<b>                         MOM
</b>             So how was your day at school?

<b>                            MASON
</b>             Fine.

<b>                         MOM
</b>             Hey, I had a good meeting with Miss
             Butler this time. I kinda liked
             her.

<b>                         MASON
</b>             What did she say?
<b>                                                            2.
</b>
<b>                      MOM
</b>          Well... she said that you weren't
          turning in your homework assignments.
          And I told her, "I know he does them,
          'cause I check them every night."
          She said she found a big chunk of
          them crumpled up at the bottom of
          your backpack.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          She didn't ask for 'em.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Well, baby, she doesn't have to.
          You're supposed to turn them in.
          And she said you're still staring
          out the window all day.

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Not all day.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          And she said that you destroyed her
          pencil sharpener.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Not on purpose.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Wait, she said that you crammed a
          bunch of rocks in it.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I thought if it could sharpen pencils,
          maybe we could sharpen rocks.

<b>                      MOM
</b>              (stifling laugh)
          Well, what were you gonna do with a
          bunch of sharpened rocks?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I was trying to make arrowheads for
          my rock collection.

<b>                         MOM
</b>          Hm.

She glances back at him, with an understanding sigh.

<b>EXT. HOUSE/DITCH - DAY
</b>
Mason rides his bike across the front yard and heads down
the street. Soon he and his friend TOMMY are riding down
the embankment of a large drainage ditch.
<b>                                                                3.
</b>
<b>EXT. DITCH - DAY
</b>
Mason runs up, as Tommy is spray-painting a drawing on the
concrete wall of the drainage ditch.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Dude, when's my turn?

<b>                      TOMMY
</b>          I don't know.

Tommy hands Mason the can of spray paint.     Mason begins to
spray-paint a letter on the wall.

<b>                      SAMANTHA (O.S.)
</b>              (calling out)
          ...Maaason.

<b>                          TOMMY
</b>          Samantha!

<b>                          SAMANTHA
</b>          Oh!    Tommy!    Is Mason down there?

<b>                          TOMMY
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Well, tell him he has to come home
          for dinner.

<b>                          TOMMY   (O.S.)
</b>          Okay.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Mason lays on the floor watching a cartoon.

There's a knock at the door, and Mom comes out to answer it.
It's TED.

<b>                          MOM
</b>          Hey.

<b>                      TED
</b>          Hey, sweetie. Why aren't you ready?
          Hey, Mason.

<b>                          MASON
</b>          Hey, Ted.

<b>                      TED

<b>                      MOM

<b>                         TED
</b>          It's nine.     Let's go, let's go.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Okay, I meant to call you, 'cause
          Janice flaked out. I don't have a
          sitter.

<b>                      TED
</b>          Why didn't you call somebody else?

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Well, I can't get a baby-sitter now,
          it's nine o'clock. But you're welcome
          to hang out with us.

<b>                      TED
</b>          Well, no. I mean we have plans.
          The guys are expecting me.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Well... you can go.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          All right. Yeah, well, I'll come
          back in a couple of hours. Is that
          okay?

<b>                         MOM
</b>          Yeah.   Yes.

<b>                         TED
</b>          All right.

<b>                         MOM
</b>          It's okay.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The kids lie on either side of Mom, as she reads a story
aloud to them.

<b>                      MOM
</b>              (Reading)
          "Turn back! Turn back! I don't wanna
          talk to Moaning Myrtle." "Who?"
          said Harry as they backtracked
          quickly. "She haunts one of the
          toilets in the girls bathroom on the
          first floor," said Hermione.
          "She haunts a toilet?"

</b>
<b>                      MOM (CONT'D)
</b>          "Yes, it's been out of order all year
          because she keeps having tantrums
          and flooding the place."
          "I never went in there anyway if I
          could avoid it. It's awful trying
          to have a pee with her wailing at
          you."

<b>INT. BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
Mason lies awake in bed listening to his mother argue with
Ted.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          Why can't you just say that?

<b>                       MOM (O.S.)
</b>          I'm sorry.   I don't want to go with
          you.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          You're sorry, that's bullshit!

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          That's right, I wanna stay here with
          my kids. That's what I'd rather do.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          All right. Would you stop using
          your kids as an excuse?!

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          I'm not using my kids as an excuse!

<b>                      TED (O.S.)

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          You have no responsibility.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          And I have responsibilities, okay,

          a parent.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          No, I don't! And why am I responsible
          for your mistakes in life?

<b>                       MOM  (O.S.)
</b>          If you had any idea. You don't think
          I wouldn't--

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Mason peeks around the corner to watch as the argument
continues.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Don't call my kids mistakes!   Don't!

<b>                      TED

          choic-- I didn't call your kids--

<b>                      MOM
</b>          You said, "Your respons-- your
          mistakes in your life," pointing at
          my kids.

<b>                      TED
</b>          I know what I said, you know what,
          and immediately you use your kids
          again.

Mason peeks through the doorway.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          This is the reality: I'm a parent!

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          That's, that's hysterical.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          That means responsibility.

<b>                      TED (O.S.)
</b>          I know you're a parent.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          I would love to have some time to

<b>                      MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Go have some dinner, go to a bar! I
          don't even know what that's like. I
          was someone's daughter, then I was
          somebody's fucking mother! Okay, I
          don't know what that's like.

<b>INT. KID'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</b>
Mason is comfortably asleep. Samantha slowly pulls the pillow
out from underneath his head and smacks him with it.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>              (singing)
          "Oops, I did it again... I played
          with your heart. Got lost in the
          game. Oh baby, baby..."

Mason throws a stuffed animal at her that she deflects.

<b>                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
</b>          "Oops, you think I'm in love. I'm
          sent from above. I'm not that
          innocent."

Another stuffed animal.    She continues to sing.

<b>                      MASON (O.S.)
</b>          Stop! Quit it!

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          "You see my problem is this. I'm
          dreaming away. Wishing that heroes
          truly exist. I cry watching the day.
          Can't you see I'm a fool in so many
          ways..."

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          "But to lose all my senses-- that
          is..."

He tries to drown out this last bit with a sustained scream.
Soon the door flies open and Mom enters, angry.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          What the hell is going on in here?!

Samantha has instantaneously shifted from singing to crying.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Do you guys know what time it is?
<b>                                                                   8.

<b>                     MOM
</b>          Mason! Do not throw things at your

<b>                      MASON

          back to bed. I don't wanna hear
          another peep out of here for an hour.
          Go to sleep.

Mom slams the door behind her.        Samantha is suddenly fine,
almost cheerful.

<b>EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Mason swings on a large outdoor swing, while Tommy sits
thumbing through a catalog. Immediately after, we see Mason
and Tommy looking through the lingerie section of the catalog
together.

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Moments later we see Mason having an introspective moment as
he gazes upon a deceased bird's carcass in the dirt.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Mom, Samantha, and Mason eat lunch.

<b>                      MOM

          so I can make us a better living.

Smack.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          With this job I can't take care of
          us the way I'd like to. I can't
          keep going this way. And Grandma
          said she'd help us out... and it
          would be nice to be near her.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>          Fine, Mother. You can do whatever
          you want but
              (shrugs)
          We're not moving.
              (Smacks)

Mason moves his fork around in his bowl.

</b>           What about our friends?

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Oh, baby, we can e-mail them or write.
           We can come back to visit. And guess
           what?

She reaches out to touch Samantha's arm.

<b>                       MOM (CONT'D)
</b>           This place that Grandma found us,
           you'll each have your own room.
           Right?

Samantha shrugs.

<b>                       MOM (CONT'D)
</b>           And there's a pool.

Samantha shrugs again, clearly not sold on the idea.

<b>INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Mason and Mom are lying on his bed together.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Mom, do you still love Dad?

<b>                       MOM
</b>           I still love your father... but that
           doesn't mean it was healthy for us
           to stay together.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           What if after we move he's trying to
           find us and he can't?

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Oh, that won't be a problem. He can
           call Grandma and she'll tell him or
           he can call Information. We won't
           be hard to find.

She pushes back his hair lovingly.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Is he still in Alaska?

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Well, that's what your uncle says.

<b>                       MASON

</b>
<b>                      MOM
</b>          Yeah... well, I hope they're taming
          him.

<b>EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</b>
The moving van drives off as mom puts another item in the
pile of stuff to be left at the curb.

<b>INT. HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Mom and Mason are getting ready to paint in the empty bedroom.
They're looking at the two lone murals, which look a little
odd without the bunk bed in front of them.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Here, wanna help me out?

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Sure.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Okay. Take this paint... very
          carefully... and paint any little
          smudge or mark or anything on the
          baseboard there, behind the door,
          and all around the doorways on the
          inside.

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Meanwhile, Samantha is talking on the phone.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>              (on phone)
          She says we're gonna come visit and
          I'm gonna write and call you. Oh,
          wait, hold on a second. I'm getting
          another call.
              (Pushes Flash)
          Hello? Sorry, Tommy, Mason can't
          come over today. We're moving. And
          I'm on the other line. Bye.
              (Pushes Button)
          Althea? I'm gonna be sending Sailor
          Scout instructions. Email, and write
          back telling me how the other scouts
          are doing. Well, because you're the
          leader now.

During the last bit of this conversation, Mason slowly paints
over the "growth chart" lines on the bedroom door jamb.
<b>                                                              12.
</b>
<b>EXT. OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR - DAY
</b>
Carrying their final belongings from inside the house, they
slowly exit the front door and head over to the car.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Okay, let's go, 'cause I wanna get
          there before it gets dark.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          Goodbye yard, goodbye crepe myrtle,
          goodbye mailbox. Goodbye box of
          stuff Mommy won't let us take with
          us but we don't wanna throw away.
          Goodbye house, I'll never like mommy
          as much for making us move.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Samantha! Why don't you say goodbye
          to that little horse shit attitude?
          Okay? 'Cause we're not taking that
          in the car.

Just before he gets in the car, Mason is looking out at the
neighborhood.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Goodbye old lady who listens to rock
          music and rides a motorcycle.

Soon the car is pulling away. As they drive off, Mason
notices out his side of the car, Tommy approaching on a bike
in the distance, gesturing toward the car. Mason watches
him out the window, but says nothing as Tommy recedes into
the distance.

<b>INT. CAR - DAY
</b>
Mason and Samantha are restless     and energetic, letting their
childish energy get the best of     them as they wrestle, hit,
and squeal at each other in the     back seat of the car. It is
all well-intentioned though, as     the two share a laugh after
Mom tells them to quiet down.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>          Eeeee!   Don't!

<b>                     MOM
</b>          Hey! Hey, what's happening back
          there? Stop, put the barrier up.

<b>                         SAMANTHA
</b>          Ahh!   Stop!    No!
<b>                                                            13.
</b>
Mason punches the pillow barrier between himself and Samantha,
while his Mom speaks.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Hey, put the pillow between you.
          Make a barrier, come on. Stop.
          We're gonna play a game called The
          Game of Silence. Whoever can stay
          quiet for the longest period of time
          wins. You guys think you can do
          that? Okay, go!

The family's car moves on toward the Houston skyline just as
dusk arrives.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Mason appears grumpy, trying to shove what he needs for the
day into his backpack quickly.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          The bus'll be here in ten minutes.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Samantha places pancakes on their plates while talking to
Mason in a cryptic language, reminiscent of pig latin.

<b>                      SAMANTHA
</b>          ...I affatay servay yoohay.

<b>                      MASON

<b>INT.   CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
Mason plays Oregon Trail on a classroom computer, while his
TEACHER speaks in the background.

<b>                       TEACHER (O.S.)
</b>           All right, nice cursive. Okay, Mason,

<b>                       TEACHER
</b>           No, let's do Apple Quit.

Mason cuts a sheet of construction paper in the shape of the
state of Texas, presumably to finish his mobile. He sits
across from a female classmate, GIRL IN RED, who teases him.

<b>                       GIRL IN RED

           "Apple Quit."

<b>INT.   GRANDMA'S HOUSE - LATER
</b>
Samantha sits with her GRANDMA, Catherine, showing off her
good grades on various school reports. Mason sits in his
own chair, playing with a Gameboy.

<b>                       SAMANTHA (O.S.)

<b>            SAMANTHA
</b>Oh, look at this owl Daddy gave me!
Isn't it cool? See, its head spins!
And look at this bracelet! It was
made by Indians in Alaska.

<b>            MASON
</b>And Mom, Daddy made this cool hand
carved grizzly bear and this tiki.

<b>            MOM
</b>It's a totem. Wow.

<b>            SAMANTHA
</b>And guess what else? We went bowling
and I made four strikes!

<b>            MASON
</b>Yeah, and we got to ride around in
Dad's car!

<b>            MOM   (O.S.)
</b>Wow.

</b>Hey, Liv.

<b>            MOM
</b>Hey.

<b>            DAD
</b>I know you wanted me to drop them
off at your mom's. I just thought
it'd be easier if I brought 'em over
here.

<b>            MOM
</b>Well, it really screwed up my plans.

<b>            MASON
</b>Well, we just wanted to show him our
rooms.

<b>            SAMANTHA
</b>Yeah.

</b>Did you guys eat anything?

</b>
<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>           Well, we had some french fries at
           the bowling alley.

<b>                       MOM
</b>           Did you do your homework or...

<b>                       MASON
</b>           No.

<b>                       SAMANTHA
</b>           Not yet.

<b>                      MOM
</b>           Okay. Can I talk to you outside for
           a second?

<b>                       DAD
</b>           Yeah. Sure.
               (as he exits)
           They had more than french fries.

The children scramble to find a suitable spot for
eavesdropping but their parents are inaudible.

<b>INT.   UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
Samantha and Mason look out the window, down at their parents
having an argument below.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Do you think he's gonna spend the

<b>                       SAMANTHA (O.S.)

Mom walks away from Dad. He stands there for a beat, then
saunters off. The kids are visibly disappointed.

<b>EXT.   COLLEGE - DAY
</b>
Mason and Mom walk across the campus lawn.

<b>INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
A professor, BILL, lectures to the class.     Mason and Mom are
seated in the classroom audience.

<b>                       BILL (V.O.)
</b>           Okay. An unconditioned stimulus,
           something that produces an unlearned,
           involuntary, unconditioned response.
<b>                       (MORE)
</b><b>                                                           30.
</b>
<b>                      BILL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Now in Pavlov's experiment, what was
          the stimulus, that he used? Come on
          now, people! Tough weekend? What's
          the deal, here? Meat. Right? Meat.
          Meat powder, actually. Whatever
          meat powder is, it worked on this
          dog. Okay. He put the meat powder
          in there and it produced an
          unconditioned response in the dog,
          which was? Salivation. Alright.
          Now, who can give me another example
          of an unconditioned stimulus-response
          pair that happens to you everyday.
          It's probably happening to some of
          you right now.
              (pause)
          How about sex? Sure, you know. You
          see an attractive member of the
          opposite gender, you have an automatic
          response. You don't have to think
          about it. Mick Jagger wrote a song
          about... Oh, when they call your
          name, I salivate like a Pavlov dog.

Class laughs.

<b>                      BILL (CONT'D)
</b>          Thank you very much. Class dismissed.

Students leave, as Mason and Mom approach the professor.

<b>                      MOM (O.S.)
</b>          Doctor Welbrock, this is my son Mason.

</b>          Ohh.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Mason, this is Dr. Welbrock.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Your son. Now see, I thought this
          was a boy genius who was taking my
          college course.

Mason laughs.    He and Bill shake hands.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          He wasn't feeling well today, so I
          thought I'd bring him with me.

Bill touches Mason's forehead.
<b>                                                         31.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Ah! No fever. It's a con job. I
          can tell because I have a nine year
          old son, he pulls this all the time.
          Same kind of deal. Hey, you play
          soccer?

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Mm, no.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Neither does my boy. He hates soccer.
          He likes computers. My 11-year-old
          daughter, loves soccer. Who can

<b>                      BILL
</b>          And thanks for coming to my class.

Mason walks ahead of them as Olivia and Bill speak a little
more intimately. It's clear that they have more than just a
professor-student relationship. Mason notices a bit of this
and looks on, confused.

<b>                         BILL (CONT'D)

<b>EXT.   BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
Mason and Samantha play an outdoor trampoline game with Randy
and Mindy, their new stepbrother and stepsister. They are
in the big backyard of their new home, where Dr. Welbrock
and his children have lived.

</b>           Hurry!    Hurry!

They all scramble inside and quickly assemble for a big
welcome home ceremony in the front entryway. A sign reads,
"Welcome Home Honeymooners, We Love You Mom &amp; Dad". Olivia
and Bill open the door to enter the house.

Hugs all around. The family talks over one another.      Bill
notices the "Welcome Home" sign the kids made.

The family sits around the table, swapping fun stories and
pictures from their time apart.

They laugh.

          Nice and easy. Sweep the floor.
          Sweep the floor. That's good. Don't
          swing too hard, Randy.

          He always swings too hard.

Randy takes a swing.

It's Mason's turn to take a swing.

</b>              (to Mason)
          Back your feet up a little bit.
          Yeah, like that. Now you're gonna
          hit it straighter. Okay. Alright,
          go up and hit it. That's good.
          Nice slow swing is going to be better
          for you.

Mason swings.

<b>EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

Bill gets out of the car.

The boys are chewing green bubble gum. Randy blows a big
bubble and Mason pops it with his hand.

<b>                      BILL
</b>          Well, I saw you working on your art

          finish your little art project but
          you didn't have time to finish your
          chores? I thought we talked about

          The boys didn't finish raking the

           it was so big that its heart was the
           size of a car? And you could crawl

Dad pulls up in his car, arriving to pick them up.

<b>                      DAD
</b>          Hey, alright! Looks good! How many

Dad spots a McCain sign in the front yard across the street.

the three of them drive off down the street.

<b>INT. COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY

</b>          His cognitive series, his interviews
          with orphans, Ethology theorists'
          work... And then he in turn was
          supported strongly by Harry Harlow's
          rhesus monkey study. Now you guys,
          you gotta think, this is the 1950's,
          this was radical! This flew in the
          face of traditional learning theory,
          of B.F. Skinner's classical and
          instrumental conditioning. Now,
          Bowlby is going to argue that human
          survival depends on us falling in
          love. It depends on me falling in
          love with my mother, and my mother
          falling in love with me. And if
          that doesn't happen, we're pretty
          much doomed. Now think about it. A
          tiger chases our tribe out of a cave.
          Now an ideal mother goes, "Huh! My
          baby! I love you! I'll protect
          you!" Or... "Well you, why am I
          going to pick you up? You're going

           he's not a baby anymore. You don't
           have to treat him like one. He's in

Mason, Chase, and Tony are now with two older guys, CHARLIE

boys are drinking beer and breaking wooden boards with their
feet.

<b>                          SENIOR GUY
</b>           Yeah!     That's what I'm talkin' about!

Chase picks up a circular saw blade and throws it into a
large piece of sheet-rock with the outline of a body on it.

<b>                      CHASE (CONT'D)

Mason also heaves the blade into the human outline.

              (Points to Tony)
          Except for you. It doesn't impress
          the ladies so much when you play

Mason nods.

<b>INT. DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
One of Mom's students, JIM, tells a story while the group
sits around the table eating.

<b>                      JIM
</b>          ...So anyway, we figured out a way
          to rig up our iPods to the external
          speakers on the ASV. So every time
          we come rolling into town, you knew
          the 456 was there, 'cause we were
          bumping House of Pain. It was like,
          "Jump around, Jump around." And the
          whole family's coming outside, and
          you got the kids and the mom and the
          dad, and they're all bouncing up and
          down. We're throwing out candies
          for the kids, and soccer balls, and
          Beanie Babies, and Frisbees... Um,
          like, smokes for the adults. And
          they loved, they absolutely loved,
          Gatorade. But for some reason, you
          know, they hated the lemon-lime
          flavor. I don't know what it was.
          Yeah. Couldn't give it away.
<b>                                                 102.

The group laughs.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          How long were you over there?

<b>                      JIM
</b>          Uhh... I did two tours in Iraq and
          one in Bosnia.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Wow.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Did you enlist?

<b>                      JIM
</b>          Mm-hmm. Yeah. I was, um, Army
          National Guard. And, uh, you know
          coming straight out of high school.
          Needed money for college. Seemed
          like a decent paying job. And, uh,
          did my tour. And whenever I got
          done, I told them if there's, you
          know, a world-changing event, I'll
          come back. And, uh, 3 months later
          9/11 happened. And I was back 9/12.
          And I'm proud to say the 456, the
          whole time we were there, we never
          lost a guy. Not one casualty.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          But is that odd?    Is that unusual?

<b>                      JIM
</b>          Yeah. Almost impossible. Like the
          guys that came along after us and
          replaced us, they didn't listen to
          any of our advice. They, you know,
          did basically the polar opposite of
          what we did, and they lost seven
          guys in the first month.

<b>                       MOM
</b>          Wow. What did you guys do
          differently?

<b>                      JIM
</b>          Well, I'd like to think it's just a
          matter of mutual respect, you know.
          I mean, all the time we spent over
          there building trust, I mean these
          guys basically destroyed it in three
          days.

<b>                       PROFESSOR DOUGLAS

</b>           So, this is like Annie's car and...
           and you drive the GTO? I guess you
           can't really put a baby seat in that
           thing.

<b>                          DAD
</b>           Yeah, no...     But I had to sell that
           anyway.

<b>                          MASON
</b>           You what?

</b>           Yeah, I had to sell that.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           So... so it's gone?

<b>                       DAD
</b>           Yeah, some sucker collector from
           California paid twenty-two grand for
           it, which is great 'cause I basically
           got to pay for this in cash. I only
           paid eighty-five hundred for that
           thing way back when. I mean, you
           know, cars are generally a terrible
           investment. You know? Soon as you
           drive them off the lot you got a used
           car on your hands, and the value's
           only dropping from there.

          Nagar's house for his birthday...
          and we were there early, so we gave
          him a ride around the block. And he

          Look, you can sit there like there's
          a death in the family, alright, but
          bottom line is that was my car.
          Alright? I paid for it, I took care
          of it, and I can do whatever I want
          with it. Alright? I'm sorry if you
          had other ideas about it but when
          you get older you can save up and
          buy a car of your own. And be cool

The family laughs, as Mason holds the gun pointing
precariously across the room.

<b>EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

Samantha holds a pistol, ready to shoot. Dad is helping her
aim. There are bottles and cans lined up as targets.

Mason holds the shotgun, taking aim.
Grandpa Cliff throws a chunk of wood up into the air as a
target.

<b>EXT. CHURCH - DAY
</b>
A small country church.

<b>                      PREACHER (O.S.)
</b>          A week later -- we don't know why
          Thomas wasn't there the first time --
          but a week later, Thomas comes back
          and joins the other disciples. They
          say, "Hey, the Lord's alive, we saw
          him!"

<b>INT. CHURCH - DAY
</b>
The preacher stands at the front of the church holding an
open bible. The family sits among the congregation. Mason
is wearing his new suit.

<b>                      PREACHER
</b>          "I won't believe it until I put my
          finger into his side and I'm gonna
          see those nail prints in his hands."
          Poof! About that time, here comes
          Jesus, standing right next to him.
          Okay? And he turns to Thomas. Don't
          you know Thomas felt some shame?
          And he turns to Thomas and says,
          "Thomas, here, stick your finger in
          my side. Look at these nail prints.
          It's me." And Thomas says, "My Lord,
          and my God, I believe."

Annie's parents nod in agreement.

<b>                      PREACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          And Jesus said, "Well, that's good.

<b>                      PREACHER (CONT'D)
</b>          But blessed are those who can believe
          without seeing." It's a lot easier
          when you can see, and feel, and touch.
          But like us, we haven't seen him in
          the flesh. We haven't felt him in
          the flesh. But we have experienced
          him in the spirit. At least I have,
          and I hope y'all have too.

<b>EXT. WOODS - DAY

The family walks through the woods. Annie holds Cooper to
her chest in a cloth carrier. Mason has his camera in hand.
Dad chews on a piece of straw.

Mason and Samantha walk down to the pond.   Annie sits on a
picnic bench with Cooper.

<b>                       MASON

          gonna take me long.

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          Not yet. Not quite. Darkroom time
          is extra-curricular. I mean
          technically, you don't ever have to
          be in here these days, and certainly
          not until you've completed your

</b>          Why is that?

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          I'll tell you why. The images you're
          turning in, they're cool. You're
          looking at things in a really unique
          way. Got a lot of natural talent.

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Thanks.

<b>                      TURLINGTON
</b>          Yeah, but, that and fifty cents will
          just get you a cup of coffee in this
          old world. I've met a lot of talented
          people over the years. How many of
          them made it professionally without
          discipline, commitment, and a really
          good work ethic?

Mason shrugs and shakes his head, unsure.

<b>                      TURLINGTON (CONT'D)
</b>          I can tell you. I can count it on
          two fingers. Zero. It's not gonna
          happen for you, Mason. The world is
          too competitive. There are too many
          talented people who are willing to
          work hard. And a butt-load of morons
          who are untalented, who are more
          than willing to surpass you. As a
          matter of fact, a lot of them are
          sitting in that classroom out there
          right now. Hm? You know what they're
          doing? They're doing their
          assignments, which is what you're
          supposed to be doing, but you're
          not. You're in here. Why is that?
          Are you special, Mason?

<b>                      MASON

          whatever, I feel like I do work pretty
          hard. I spend the whole weekend

          football game tonight. Okay? It
          starts at 7:30. I want you to get
          there early. I want you to shoot a
          full card, three hundred images, and
          I want 'em downloaded, I want 'em
          sorted, and I want to see them very
          first thing Monday. Okay? You want

          share somethin' with you, I got you
          pegged for fry cook this summer, now
          that's a lot more responsibility.

          I think you can, because I believe

          when Trevor deleted his Facebook

</b>Yeah, but still --

every day of your life that you spend
crying over some silly girl is a

</b>I don't know.

<b>            DAD
</b>Here's the truth. Women are never

</b>Sheena.

</b>Alright. It means you are responsible
for you, not your girlfriend, not

the litter when them front-running

take up lacrosse.

her.

</b>Alright. I'm sick to death of her,
okay? I only met her a few times
and yes she was cute, alright. But,
truth be told I always thought she
was a little bit, you know, a little
bit too square for you. Y'know, not
quite the same vibe.

<b>            MASON
</b>You really thought that?

</b>On some subtle, lower level. I mean,
uh, I wasn't surprised when it turned
out she was interested in some
knucklehead lacrosse player, okay?
I mean, bottom line is, it's all
timing with these things. Y'know.
I mean, uh, take your mom and me.
Y'know I think I probably turned
into the boring castrated guy she
wanted me to be fifteen or twenty
years ago, y'know? And man I'm not
saying she was wrong to be pissed.
I'm not, I'm just saying that, y'know,
she could have been a little more
patient... a little more forgiving.

</b>          You guys should listen to her.   She's

Ernesto walks back toward the kitchen, leaving the three
seated at the table.

<b>EXT. APARTMENT - MORNING
</b>
Mason, now with a scruffy beard, is wedging a duffel bag and
bin into the bed of his truck. He walks back toward Mom's
new apartment.
<b>                                                          173.
</b>
<b>INT. APARTMENT - MORNING
</b>
Mason is packing a box, in mid-conversation with Mom, who is
seated in another room.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          ...Isn't that kind of crazy though,
          that a computer knows who you are
          from just twenty questions off a
          form? I guess there are really only
          like eight types of people in the
          world.

Mom goes to the kitchen and pours coffee into a mug.

<b>                      MASON (CONT'D)
</b>          I mean there are subsets, like male
          and female, but apparently we're not
          as unique as we want to think we
          are.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Have you even talked to this guy
          yet?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          No, but we've been trading emails.
          He seems pretty cool. He's studying
          literature, and uh, anthropology,
          and he's way into Bright Eyes... so
          that's not so bad. But anyways, he
          was telling me about how the system
          they use for assigning roommates is
          kind of spooky. Like, the Freshmen
          satisfaction rate for new roommates
          used to be like 60%, and now it's
          100%. Just cause of the computer.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Well. Sounds like he'll be a good
          roommate, then.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Yeah. But we've pretty much decided
          that soon they won't even need a
          questionnaire. Because they'll just
          let the NSA scan your digital ghost,
          and they'll tell you who your roommate
          is, based on everything you've ever
          said, written, or clicked.

Mason walks back into the living room, carrying a box.   He
holds up a framed picture.
<b>                                                            174.
</b>
<b>                      MASON (CONT'D)
</b>          Did you -- Did you put this in here
          again?

Mom laughs.

<b>                      MASON (CONT'D)
</b>          I don't want it.

<b>                      MOM
</b>          Come on, it's the first picture you
          ever took.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Well, I mean, all the more reason to
          leave it behind, right?

Mason goes to put the picture back in his room, while Mom
suddenly breaks into quiet sobs.

He comes back out, wearing a backpack, and notices Mom crying.

<b>                         MASON (CONT'D)
</b>          What?

<b>                         MOM
</b>              (crying)
          Nothing.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          No, what is it?

<b>                         MOM
</b>          Nothing!

</b>          This is the worst day of my life.

</b>          What are you talking about?

<b>                      MOM
</b>          I knew this day was coming. I just --
          I didn't know you were gonna be so
          fuckin' happy to be leaving.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I mean, it's not that I'm that happy.
          What do you, what do you expect?
<b>                                                             175.
</b>
<b>                      MOM
</b>          You know what I'm realizing? My
          life is just gonna go, like that!
          This series of milestones. Getting
          married, having kids, getting
          divorced, the time that we thought
          you were dyslexic, when I taught you
          how to ride a bike, getting divorced
          AGAIN, getting my masters degree,
          finally getting the job I wanted,
          sending Samantha off to college,
          sending YOU off the college... You
          know what's next? Huh? It's my
          fuckin' funeral!

A beat.

<b>                      MOM (CONT'D)
</b>          Just go, and leave my picture!

Stunned, Mason doesn't know what to say.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Aren't you jumping ahead by like,
          forty years or something?

<b>                      MOM
</b>          I just thought there would be more.

Mom sits at the table crying.   Mason does not know how to
comfort her.

<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
Mason drives his pick-up truck through the open roads and
mountains of West Texas.

<b>EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
</b>
Mason stops at a gas station to fill up.   While he waits, he
takes pictures.

<b>EXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY
</b>
Mason pulls into the parking lot of his University and parks.

<b>INT. DORM - AFTERNOON
</b>
Mason walks through a hallway area and finds his dorm room.
He enters to find it half decorated with music going. He
throws his bag up on the available bed and starts to unpack
and get situated. DALTON enters.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Hey, you must be Mason.
<b>                                                       176.
</b>
<b>                       MASON
</b>          Yeah.   Dalton, right?

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Yeah, man, it's nice to finally meet
          you.

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Definitely.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Are you cool with this side of the
          room?

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Got in this morning, just moved my
          shit in, man.

<b>                       MASON
</b>              (laughs)
          Well, yeah. I don't- I don't care.
          No worries.

He unzips his bag, but keeps the conversation going.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Cool. Can I help with anything,
          man? Any bags? Any last stuff you
          need brought in?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          I just got like one... box left, I
          packed pretty light. But I appreciate
          it.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          My pleasure, man. Of course.

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Um, are you goin' to the orientation
          mixer thing?

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Orientation mixer thing? Fuck no,
          man! I'm not goin' to that and
          neither are you, by the way. We got
          way better stuff to be doin', dude.

BARB, Dalton's girlfriend, drifts into the room.

<b>                        BARB
</b>          You ready?
<b>                                                           177.
</b>
<b>                     DALTON
</b>          Yeah. Hey, Barb, this' my roommate
          Mason. Mason, Barb.

They shake.

<b>                       MASON
</b>          Hi.

<b>                       BARB
</b>          Hey.   You comin' with us?

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Where're you going?

<b>                       BARB
</b>          Hiking.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Yeah, man, you should come. If we
          leave now we can catch the late
          afternoon at Big Bend. You ever
          been before, man?

<b>                     MASON
</b>          Yeah. But not since I was really
          little.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Oh, well then all the more reason to
          come now, man. That's why we're
          here, dude.

Barb's roommate, NICOLE, is now hanging out by the door.

<b>                       DALTON (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh, Mason.   This is Nicole, Barb's
          roommate.

<b>                      NICOLE
</b>          Hey, what's up?

<b>                       MASON

Barb is reaching in her bag for something.

<b>                      DALTON
</b>          Mason, Nicole.

<b>                      BARB
</b>              (to Mason)
          So, you game?
<b>                                                            178.
</b>
<b>                        MASON
</b>          Sure.

She has produced a chunk of brownie that she hands to Mason.

<b>                      BARB
</b>          Here. Have the rest of this. Got
          it timed perfectly. It'll kick in
          when we get to the mountains.

Mason takes it, a little amused, looks at the others
(confirmation), then starts to consume.

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Awesome.

<b>                        DALTON (O.S.)
</b>          Let's go.

They roll out of there.

<b>EXT. BIG BEND - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
Mason, Nicole, Dalton and Barb hike through a BIG canyon.
Nicole talks to Mason about teaching dance.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          Do they let you major in that here?

<b>                      NICOLE
</b>          Well, it's not that serious here, so
          I kinda like train outside the
          university, but I'm taking all my
          basics like History of Dance and all
          that.

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Nice.

<b>                        NICOLE
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          What do you teach?

<b>                     NICOLE
</b>          Oh, gosh. Ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical,
          hip-hop...

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Wow.    Which one's your favorite?

<b>                        NICOLE
</b>          Tap.
<b>                                     179.
</b>
<b>                  MASON
</b>Yeah?

<b>            NICOLE
</b>Yeah. You can make up all your own
sounds and there's no rules.

<b>                  MASON
</b>Right...

<b>            NICOLE
</b>Just, like, creative freedom.

<b>            MASON
</b>That's great.

<b>                  NICOLE
</b>Yeah.

<b>                  MASON
</b>Right.

<b>            NICOLE
</b>... So to be a part of bringing it
back to the kids...

<b>            MASON
</b>Right, keep it going.

<b>            NICOLE
</b>... Is really rewarding.   Yeah.

<b>            MASON
</b>How old are they?

<b>            NICOLE
</b>Six to eight.

<b>                  MASON
</b>       (laughs)
Wow.

<b>            NICOLE
</b>    (laughing)
Yeah. They have like no fear, and
they're not self-conscious at all.

<b>            MASON
</b>They haven't reached the awkward
years yet.

<b>            NICOLE
</b>Yeah, not yet. It's coming.
<b>                                                            180.
</b>
The group continues walking over a ridge as the sun is
setting.

<b>EXT. HIKE - LATER
</b>
As Barb and Dalton coyote call on the rocks, Mason joins
Nicole sitting on a rock overlooking the river and sunset.

<b>                         NICOLE
</b>          Hey.

Dalton and Barb continue like coyotes, much to Nicole and
Mason's amusement.

<b>                      NICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>          Dalton can be crazy sometimes.

<b>                      MASON
</b>          He seems cool, though.

<b>                         NICOLE
</b>          Yeah.     Yeah, they're both really
          cool.     How are you feeling?

They both laugh.

<b>                        MASON
</b>          Great.    Really great, to be honest.

<b>                      NICOLE
</b>          Good. I'm really happy that you're
          hangin' out with us.

<b>                         MASON
</b>          Yeah.     Me too.

Meanwhile, over on a big rock, the coyotes are now yelling
words.

<b>                      DALTON (O.S.)
</b>          This moment's having a multiple
          orgasm! It's like as if all of time
          has unfolded before us so we can
          stand here and look out and scream -
          Fuck yea!! Wooo!

Back with Nicole and Mason laughing.

<b>                      NICOLE
</b>          You know how everyone's always saying,
          "Seize the moment"?

Mason nods yes.
<b>                                                  181.
</b>
<b>                       NICOLE (CONT'D)
</b>           I don't know, I'm kinda thinkin'
           it's the other way around. You know,
           like, the moment seizes us.

<b>                       MASON
</b>           Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's constant,
           the moments, it's just... it's like
           always right now, you know?

<b>                      NICOLE
</b>           Yeah.

They trade smiles.
