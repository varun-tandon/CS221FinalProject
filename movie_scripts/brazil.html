<b>1   EXT.   CITYSCAPE                         SUNSET           1
</b>
    A beautiful golden sun is setting. The sky is on fire. The
    CAMERA starts to move downwards. A large neon sign rises
    into shot. It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the
    frame. The building is neither past nor future in design
    but a bit of both.
<b>    
</b>    Slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads
    below ... A glittering conglomeration of elevated
    transport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely
    huge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule
    relics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level
    awnings suggesting restaurants and shops ... Transparent
    tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us ... an
    elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of
    large transport lorries passes thru frame. As we descend,
    the sunlight is blocked out and street lights &amp; neon signs
    take over as illumination. Eventually we reach the upper
    levels of a plush shopping precinct.

<b>2   INT.   SHOPPING PRECINT                  NIGHT            2
</b><b>    
</b>    Xmas decorations are everywhere. PEOPLE are busy buying,
    ogling, discussing, choosing wisely from the goodies on
    display. SHOPPERS are going by laden with superbly
    packaged goods ... the shop windows are full of
    elaborately boxed and be-ribboned who-knows-what. In one
    window is a bank of TV sets - on the great majority of the
    screens is the face of MR. HELPMANN - the Deputy Minister
    of Information. He is being interviewed. No-one bothers to
    listen to HELPMANN.

<b>                          INTERVIEWER
</b>               Deputy minister, what do you believe
               is behind this recent increase in
               terrorist bombings?

<b>                           HELPMANN
</b>               Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless
               minority of people seems to have
               forgotten certain good old fashioned
               virtues. They just can't stand seeing
               the other fellow win. If these people
               would just play the game, instead of
               standing on the touch line heckling -

<b>                          INTERVIEWER
</b>               In fact, killing people -

<b>                           HELPMANN
</b>               - In fact, killing people - they'd
               get a lot more out of life.

    We PULL AWAY from the shop to concentrate on the shoppers.
    HELPMANN's voice carries over the rest of the scene.

<b>                          INTERVIEWER
</b>               Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to
               those critics who maintain that the
               Ministry Of Information has become
               too large and unwieldy ...?

<b>                           HELPMANN
</b>               David ... in a free society
               information is the name of the game.
               You can't win the game if you're a
               man short.

    Fur bedecked shoppers pass in front of what appears to be
    banks of snow but as we pan along with them the "snow"
    turns out to be fire-fighting foam. It oozes out of a shop
    front that is a charred twisted mass of metal frames.
    WORKMEN are busily sealing the opening with plywood
    sheets, SHOPPERS pay no attention to this. Xmas carols are
    being played by a Salvation Army style band calling
    themselves Consumers For Christ. Santa Claus's grotto is
    busy, all is well with the world.

<b>                          INTERVIEWER
</b>               And the cost of it all, Deputy
               Minister? Seven percent of the gross
               national produce ...

<b>                           HELPMANN
</b>               I understand this concern on behalf
               of the tax-payers. People want value
               for money and a cost-effective
               service.

<b>3   INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT            3
</b>
    CUT TO TV screen with HELPMANN still talking.

<b>                           HELPMANN
</b>               That is why we always insist on the
               principle of Information Retrieval
               Charges. These terrorists are not
               pulling their weight, and it's
               absolutely right and fair that those
               found guilty should pay for their
               periods of detention and the
               Information Retrieval Procedures used
               in their interrogation.

    PULL BACK to reveal a rather clinical office. The TV rests
    on a desk. A WHITE COATED TECHNICIAN is sorting out his in-
    tray. Several Christmas cards are amongst he paperwork. He
    comes upon a Christmassy package which he rips open, to
    discover a shiny, metal "executive toy".

    CUT TO the BEETLE droning up near the ceiling.

    The TECHNICIAN is disturbed by the buzz of the BEETLE as
    it whirrs around the fluorescent light. He rolls up some
    paper and forms and gets up to swat the insect.

Scenes 4-12 Deleted.                              4-12 Deleted.

<b>13  INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT           13
</b><b>    
</b>    The TECHNICIAN gets up and balances a chair on top of his
    desk. He climbs up onto it attempting to swat the BEETLE
    still buzzing about the room just out of reach. Beneath
    him an automatic type-writing machine rattles away
    compiling a typed list of names under the heading
    "Information Retrieval, Subjects For Detention &amp;
    Interview". The machine is being fed from a spool of paper
    which is being rhythmically chopped by an automatic
    guillotine which neatly leaves each name on a separate
    sheet, with the title above each name, each sheet
    following its predecessor into a holding basket. In CLOSE-
    UP we see the names on the sheets of paper building up in
    the holding basket: TONSTED, Simon ... TOPPER, Martin F.
    ... TROLLOPE, Benjamin G. ... TURB, William K. ... TURNER,
    John D. ... Every name begins with T.

<b>                          INTERVIEWER
</b>               Do you think that the government is
               winning the battle against
               terrorists?

<b>                           HELPMANN
</b>               On yes. Our morale is much higher
               than theirs, we're fielding all their
               strokes, running a lot of them out,
               and pretty consistently knocking them
               for six. I'd say they're nearly out
               of the game.
<b>               
</b>    The TECHNICIAN is tottering on one leg on the chair on the
    desk as he strains to swat the BEETLE. Swish, swash, oops,
    WHAP! Gottcha!!

<b>                          INTERVIEWER
</b>               But the bombing campaign is now in
               its thirteenth year ...

<b>                           HELPMANN
</b>               Beginner's luck.

    The BEETLE's career comes to a halt ... squashed flat on
    the brilliantly clean ceiling ... or has it? As the
    TECHNICIAN clambers down from the rickety heights, the
    BEETLE's carcass comes unstuck from the ceiling and drops
    silently into the typewriting machine which hiccoughs,
    hesitates and then types the letter "B" and hesitates and
    then continues so that the next name is BUTTLE, Archibald.

    The TECHNICIAN fails to notice this and the machine
    continues smoothly TUTWOOD, Thomas T. ... TUZCZLOW,
    Peter...

<b>                          INTERVIEWER
</b>               Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.

<b>                           HELPMANN
</b>               Thank you, David ... and a very merry
               Christmas to you all.

<b>14  EXT.   HOUSING TOWERS                    NIGHT           14
</b><b>    
</b>    ZOOMING past foreground outdoor Xmas decorations we
    TIGHTEN in on one of several massive residential tower
    blocks that loom over what appears to be a poorer part of
    the city

<b>15  INT.   BUTTLE FLAT                       NIGHT           15
</b><b>    
</b>    HELPMANN and INTERVIEWER are on the TV, the end credits
    rolling over them to the beat of a Mozart theme tune.
    PULLING BACK we reveal that the TV is in a conventional
    sitting room, conventionally decorated for Christmas; out
    the room is oddly encumbered by huge metal conduits that
    snake unpleasantly across and through the walls. Smaller
    conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various
    services that Central Services (the name emblazoned on the
    metal) supply to this household. A conventionally poor but
    proud family occupies the room. MRS BUTTLE is reading
    Dickens' Christmas Carol to GIRL BUTTLE who is about six.
    BOY BUTTLE plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some
    action men dressed in security gear. MR. BUTTLE is putting
    the final touches to a neatly wrapped Christmas present
    which looks identical to the "executive toy" we have just
    seen in he TECHNICIAN'S office.

    Faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter. A tilt of
    the CAMERA indicates that the laughter is coming from the
    floor above.

<b>16  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       NIGHT           16
</b>
    The flat is very bare and basic. The laughter is coming
    from a cheap portable television showing "Sgt. Bilko. From
    BILKO'S POV we look through an open door of a bathroom
    straight at a mirror propped up by the bath, to enable the
    person in the bath to watch the TV. The person in the bath
    is JILL LAYTON, washing the grime off herself while she
    watches Bilko in the mirror. From her POV in the mirror,
    the T.V. screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body
    of a MAN in uniform.

<b>                             JILL
</b>                    (scared)
               Who's there?

<b>17  INT.   BUTTLE'S FLAT                     NIGHT           17
</b><b>    
</b>    The BUTTLE FAMILY as before. MRS BUTTLE is closing the
    book.

<b>                          MRS BUTTLE
</b>               There, that's enough for tonight. He
               won't come Xmas Eve if you don't get
               plenty of sleep.

<b>                          GIRL BUTTLE
</b>               Father Christmas can't come if we
               haven't got a chimney.

<b>                          MRS BUTTLE
</b>               You'll see.

    The GIRL exchanges goodnight kisses with her parents and
    leaves the room.

<b>                          GIRL BUTTLE
</b>               How will he get down from upstairs?

<b>                          BOY BUTTLE
</b>               It's a secret.

    We follow GIRL BUTTLE out of the sitting room into ...

<b>18  INT.   HALLWAY AND CHILDREN'S BEDROOM    NIGHT           18
</b>
    GIRL BUTTLE enters her bedroom. There is little or no
    light there, and she sees a bulky figure apparently
    lowering himself into the room from the direction of the
    ceiling.

<b>                          GIRL BUTTLE
</b>                    (unalarmed)
               You've come ...

    As she moves, the light from the hallway shows us the
    figure of what looks like a commando on a night raid,
    slowly sliding down a pole in he middle of the room. The
    pole at the top end disappears through a hole in the
    ceiling. Things become immediately clearer

<b>19  INT.   BUTTLE SITTING-ROOM               NIGHT           19
</b>
    Crash! It's a raid! Battle-dressed SECURITY TROOPS smash
    trough the door. Another ONE, swings from a rope, kicks in
    the window from the outside and enters that way. Most
    alarmingly of all, a shower of plaster comes down from the
    ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and
    through the hole comes a fireman's pole down which slide
    TWO MORE SECURITY TROOPS. The whole thing is short, brutal
    and violent.
<b>    
</b>    BUTTLE is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike
    canvas device that covers him from head to waist. A metal
    clamp goes round his neck, a metal bar slides up the back
    of the bag. His hands are handcuffed to the metal bar. In
    seconds he has become a canvas parcel. Meanwhile, GIRL
    BUTTLE has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into
    the lap of her screaming mother. BOY BUTTLE has his toy
    machine gun knocked out of his hands by a TROOPER who we
    see is identical in dress to the action men BOY BUTTLE has
    been playing with. He rushes to his mother as guns are
    viciously trained on them. TROOPS are kicking open the
    doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job. An
    OFFICIAL, wearing plain clothes, now enters from the front
    door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an
    official document. It goes something like this:

<b>                           OFFICIAL
</b>               I hereby inform you under powers
               entrusted to me under Section 47,
               Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number
               438476, that Mr Buttle, Archibald,
               residing at 412 North Tower, Shangri
               La Towers, has been invited to assist
               the Ministry of Information with
               certain enquiries, the nature of
               which may be ascertained on
               completion of application form
               BZ/ST/486/C fourteen days within this
               date, and that he is liable to
               certain obligations as specified in
               Council Order 173497, including
               financial restitutions which may or
               may not be incurred if Information
               Retrieval procedures beyond those
               incorporated in Article 7 subsections
               8, 10 &amp; 32 are required to elicit
               information leading to permanent
               arrest - notification of which will
               he served with the time period of 5
               working days as stipulated by law. In
               that instance the detainee will be
               debited without further notice
               through central banking procedures
               without prejudice until and unless at
               such a time when re-imbursement

               or third parties on completion of a
               re-imbursement form RB/CZ/907/X ...

    ... and more of the same, most of which is part of the
    audible wall paper while the chaos reigns. As the front
    door slams behind the captive relative peace returns,
    broken by MRS BUTTLE's anguished sobbing.

    JILL's shocked face appears looking down through the hole

    also appear, above and behind her.

    The helmeted SECURITY TROOPS in Buttle's flat drop to
    defensive positions and swing their machine guns up
    towards the hole in the ceiling. All three faces retreat.

    coils the rope up neatly and the TWO SECURITY MEN leave

20a INT.   BUTTLES' FLAT                     NIGHT          20a
<b>    
</b>    MRS BUTTLE stands stunned in the middle of her decimated
    flat. The KIDS wail. Slowly MRS BUTTLE collapses -
    slumping to the floor with the receipt in her hand: we
    tighten into CLOSE UP of "Receipt".

                       JILL (off CAMERA)
               Mrs Buttle? Mrs Buttle?

<b>21  INT.   RECORD CLERK'S POOL                               21
</b><b>    
</b>    We come in on a CLOSE UP of a pink version of the RECEIPT
    being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we PULL OUT to
    reveal an infinite expanse of regularly arranged metal
    desks, each desk with a built-in T.V. console, and each
    (except one) occupied by a CLERK. Every desk is snowed
    under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in
    the previous scene. More pacers are delivered to each desk
    intermittently by way of pneumatic tube. OFFICE BOYS
    bustle about with even more paperwork. From the back of
    the room we get a view of the screens which show graphs,
    tabulations, figures ... All of this activity is
    supervised from an elevated walkway by MR KURTZMAN.
    Satisfied that all is well with his clerks he turns and
    walks towards his glass enclosed private office at the top
    of the room, his name lettered on the opaque glass door.

    MR KURTZMAN goes through this door and as he closes it
    behind him, all activity in the CLERKS pool ceases. each
    CLERK adjusts his T.V. screen with the flick of a switch,
    and all the screens change to something which looks very
    like "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly".

<b>22  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             22
</b><b>    
</b>    MR KURTZMAN also has a T.V. console. He sits behind his
    desk, reaches for his In-tray, and without looking at the
    console he turns his screen on. He looks through a number
    of files in his In-tray. He is surprised to hear a VOICE
    say, "Turn around real slow, amigo". MR KURTZMAN turns
    around real slow, his expression relaxes, he thumps his
    T.V. console with a large fist, and the screen obediently
    flicks to a display of figures. He picks up a file which
    we see as marked "Buttle, Archibald". He opens the file
    and starts punching the keyboard of the console. The T.V.
    starts bleeping in an alarmed way. MR KURTZMAN is puzzled.
    He punches more figures. The screen starts to flash
    "Error, error, error". MR KURTZMAN sighs with frustration.
    He presses an intercom.
<b>                          MR KURTZMAN
</b>                    (into intercom)
               Mr Lowry, will you step in here
               please?
<b>               
</b>    He returns his attention, puzzled to the file. Nobody
    comes into the office. MR KURTZMAN gets up and walks over
    to his door and opens it. Beyond the door the room full of
    CLERKS is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and
    whirring consoles. From MR KURTZMAN'S POV we see that in
    the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk.

<b>                          MR KURTZMAN
</b>               Does anyone know where Lowry is?

    Nobody knows. MR KURTZMAN closes his door again. A moment
    later it seems to him, and to us, that he has heard the
    crash of six guns blazing away at each other. He re-opens
    the door. The only sound again. He goes back to his desk.
    He punches a few keys. The machine starts emitting even
    more alarming beeps, then horse whinnies, then "Admit
    you're whupped, you drygulching scum". KURTZMAN explodes
    with anger, and presses the intercom again.

<b>                          MR KURTZMAN
</b>                    (Shouting into intercom)
               Where the hell is Sam Lowry?!

<b>23  EXT.   SKY                               DAY             23
</b><b>    
</b>    CUT TO brilliantly clear sky. From on high an odd bird-
    like figure swoops down on the CAMERA. As it comes closer
    we can see that it is, in fact, a MAN wearing strange wood
    and metal bird wings. In the bright sunshine their
    flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect.
    Along with the wings, SAM LOWRY (for this is he) wears an
    outfit that combines the best of Flash Gordon and a WWI
    fighter pilot. He sweeps past the CAMERA and then,
    banking, rises BACK INTO SHOT IN MCU. An ethereal voice
    can be heard calling "Sam ... Sam ... Sam". He hovers,
    looking beyond the CAMERA to something wonderful. CUT TO
    face of stunningly beautiful GIRL, she is the idealised
    twin of JILL LAYTON ... Her long hair swirls across her
    face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightly
    mysterious. The CAMERA PULLS AWAY from her as soft
    billowing material sinuously undulates about her. It rises
    and falls like waves carried on the wind. As the CAMERA
    GLIDES BACK through this sea of gossamer we can see that
    the GIRL is being held aloft by and in it. A vast
    landscape stretches below her. The sun frames her in the
    sky. She and SAM are engaged in a beautiful sensual aerial
    ballet.
<b>    
</b>    Romantic music fills the soundtrack.
<b>    
</b>    SAM swoops up and away. The GIRL floats in the distance as
    SAM. rises in the foreground. She beckons to him. SAM
    begins to flap back towards her. But then the dreamy
    quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening
    rumble. SAM looks down.
<b>    
</b>    The ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive,
    monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and
    soars upwards with a mighty rush.
<b>    
</b>    CUT to the GIRL in LONG SHOT. The monolith rises up into
    FRAME partially cutting her off from view.
<b>    
</b>    Before SAM can do anything, another stone skyscraper
    breaks through the ground and rushes upwards. Then another
    and another. There is nothing SAM can do. The GIRL is
    being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless
    structures. And then she is finally lost from view
    somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis.
    SAM lies closer. The stone skyscrapers appear to be solid.
    No windows. No doors. Nothing whatsoever to interfere with
    their clean, harsh, rectilinear design. As he flies among
    these towering blocks he sees no sign of the GIRL, only
    sheer walls rising high above him. Below him the walls
    plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets. No sound
    but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in
    this dead place. Coming round a corner he sees something
    in the distance. far below him a dark procession is
    wending its way through the narrow passages... away from
    him.
<b>    
</b>    CUT TO LOW ANGLE SHOT of the procession making its way
    past the CAMERA. Black-robed and cowled, the sinister
    figures look like heavily armed monks. These are the
    FORCES OF DARKNESS. Together they are straining at several
    heavy hawsers that rise in long arcs up to a huge metal
    cage floating above and behind the procession. Binding the
    cage are metal straps to which ropes are attached. Inside
    is the GIRL - still enveloped in gossamer which billows as
    if there were a breeze in constant attendance.
<b>    
</b>    CUT TO SAM as He dives out of shot.
<b>    
</b>    CUT to the FORCES OF DARKNESS suddenly stopping in their
    tracks. They've seen something.
<b>    
</b>    CUT to their POV. There at the end of the passage between
    two stone skyscrapers stands SAM ... barring the way.
<b>    
</b>    CUT to swords being unsheathed. Cowls being thrown back.
    Underneath are rotting, broken dolls' faces. All the faces
    are the same except for the manner in which they have
    decayed. They smile - slobbering, sickeningly. Suddenly
    the robed bodies change shape - some rising up to become
    long, others expanding sideways to become bulbous, others
    shrinking. From the folds of cloth come evil weapons. The
    FORCES are massed ready to charge.
    CUT to long shot of SAM. He removes his arms from his
    wings and folds the wings behind him. He is ready.
<b>    
</b>    Cut to the FORCES. Nothing moves ... except for the
    constant dribble from their cracked mouths.

    CUT back to SAM. Stillness. The tension is unbearable.
    Suddenly SAM unleashes a terrifying scream and charges the
    fearsome horde. Unarmed!

    CUT to the FORCES thundering down to SAM. Weapons flailing
    madly.

    SAM skillfully dodges the swordthrust of the leading
    field, and karate chops him senseless - at the same time
    catching his sword as he falls. Spinning around he parries
    a spearthrust and skewers a third attacker. Slash! Hack!
    Stab! He lays waste to the FORCES. Nothing can stop this
    boy. The pile of black-robed bodies grows with each swing
    of SAM's sword. Wham! Bam! Smash! SAM carves his way
    through the mob with nary a scratch. And then, suddenly,
    they are all dead, but a heap of blackness to commemorate
    SAM's prowess. The GIRL is beaming as SAM makes his way
    toward the hawsers holding the cage. But then a noise
    behind him makes him turn. There, behind him the pile of
    black shapes begin to rise. The ropes become a mass of
    flapping black cloth. This evil churning cloud coalesces
    and lifts off the ground. The horrible flapping apparition
    emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away. SAM
    is about to rush after it to halt its escape but is
    stopped by the sound of a telephone ringing. He looks
    around - confused.

<b>24  INT.   SAM'S BEDROOM                     MORNING         24
</b>
    TIGHT SHOT of telephone. The ringing continues. A hand
    grapples with the receiver. SAM is in bed in a darkened
    room. Sleepily he drags receiver to his ear.

<b>                              SAM
</b>               Hello ... What ... what? Oh ... Mr
               Kurtzman! ... You're up late. Oh, is
               it?

    There is an electronic box of tricks by his bed,
    incorporating an alarm. SAM thumps it. The alarm goes off.
    This sets of a series of other things ... The window
    shutters roll up letting in the morning light. Both taps
    turn on in the bathroom ...

<b>                              SAM
</b>                    (into phone)
               The electronics here are up the
               spout. Yours too, sir? Don't worry
               sir - I'll be there.

    SAM puts down the phone and gets into his suit which is
    moving towards him. Noticing one of his film posters is
    loose he pushes the pin in firmly.
<b>    
</b>    In the kitchen a coffee maker starts up. In the sitting
    room the television switches on. Back in the bedroom a
    cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with
    SAM's clothes neatly hanging - ready to be put on. SAM
    comes out of the bathroom, having turned off the bath
    taps, and starts to get dressed. In the kitchen the coffee-
    maker has finished making s small pot of coffee. SAM pours
    a quick cup and is gone at the door. Throughout all this
    we have had a chance to get a glimpse of SAM's flat. It is
    functional, soulless and, though neat, has not been
    assembled with a loving hand. Most of the furnishings are
    built in. The walls are divided into two-foot square metal
    panels painted a non-committal colour. Certain of the wall
    panels have Central Services logos on them with the
    admonition "Do not obstruct or remove" below. SAM has
    livened his bedroom up with large and colorful film
    posters. The sitting room sports several framed pictures
    of wide beautiful vistas.

<b>25  INT.   MINISTRY OF INFORMATION LOBBY     DAY             25
</b>
    This is a gigantic, vaguely 30's monumental-style
    building. The lobby is a vast impressive space containing
    reception desks, fountains, statues etc. Prominent are the
    security measures, which include automatic mobile cameras,
    video screens and groups of SECURITY MEN who search all
    who enter. SAM is finishing going through Security when he
    meets JACK who is on his way out of the building.

<b>                             JACK

<b>                             JACK
</b>               Me? - if I'm worried about anyone,
               it's you. What happened to you, Sam?
               You were the brightest of us -

    As they have been talking, a nearby bank of closed circuit
    TV screens has been displaying shots of people entering
    the lobby. As each one enters the CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT on
    their faces for a frozen CLOSE-UP. JILL has just entered
    and the CAMERA ZOOMS IN and freezes on her face. SAM
    happens to glance up at this moment. He is startled - the
    over-exposed TV image is the face of the GIRL FROM THE
    DREAM. The face is only there a few seconds before being
    replaced by another picture. SAM looks about to see where
    the GIRL is, but JILL, in overalls, has her back to him as
    she stands in the queue for the Information desk and so
    there is no-one even vaguely reminiscent of the DREAM
    GIRL. SAM decides he must have imagined it. Over this JACK
    has been talking.

<b>                             JACK
</b>               What's the matter?
<b>

</b>               Sorry. Nothing.
                    (snapping out of it)
               See you - I'm going to be late.

<b>                             JACK
</b>                    (looking at his watch)
               You are late.

<b>                              SAM
</b>               Even later.

<b>                             JACK
</b>               Sam, your life is going wrong - let
               your friends tell you - Records is a
               dead end department, no Security
               Level worth a damn, it's impossible
               to get noticed -

<b>                              SAM
</b>               Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous,
               wonderful - remember me to Alison -
               and the - er - twins.

<b>                             JACK

<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM
</b>               Really? - God, how time flies!
<b>    
</b>    As SAM heads off to the lift, he passes a group of MEN
    standing around a temporary TV monitor. Several of them
    are dressed in white lab coats. They are being explained
    the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman
    type. His assistant is operating the controls. On the
    monitor we can see JILL standing in the queue for the
    Information desk. The CAMERA appears to he tracking in on
    her.
<b>    
</b>    CUT TO JILL at top of queue with several forms in her
    hand. A strange prototype radio controlled camera on a
    wheeled base is whirring and clicking as it approaches
    her. Throughout the next sequence it pokes around JILL in
    an annoying manner - thrusting itself at her face, trying
    to see what is written on the forms, peering over her
    shoulder. JILL hands a form to the Information Porter.
<b>    
</b><b>                             JILL

               I've been to Information Adjustments.
               They sent me here. They told me you

               stamped.

<b>    
</b>    The radio-controlled camera noses right up to JILL's face
    as she turns. She swats the annoying thing with her stack
    of forms as she storms off. The camera overbalances and
    crashes into the desk - sparking and spluttering.
<b>    
</b>    CUTTING BACK to the GROUP around the monitor we see a
    deeply hurt SALESMAN and several sceptical white-coated
<b>    TECHNICIANS.

</b><b>    
</b>    CUT TO an old WOMAN's face reflected in triplicate in a
    three-panelled mirror. A pair of MAN's hands have a grip
    on her flabby cheeks, pulling them out several inches on
    either side of her face. When I say several inches that's
    just what I mean. Not only are her jowls being stretched
    like silly putty but they are also being wrapped around to
    the back of her neck to demonstrate how tight and smooth
    her face can be made by DOCTOR who is prattling on over
    this freak show.

               ... and there ...
<b>    
</b>    CUT TO WIDE SHOT of DOCTOR's surgery. It looks a bit like
    a cross between an operating theatre and a boudoir. The
    cold steel, glass and plastic surfaces are badly disguised
    with pastel coloured chintz and satin. At the dressing
    table sits the old WOMAN, SAM'S MOTHER. Behind her stands
    the DOCTOR. He is much like his surgery. He has tailored
    his surgical garments like a gigolo's dressing gown. It
    seems that he has done a bit of tuck-taking on himself.
    There is a certain plastic smoothness to his skin, but all
    in all he has been fairly successful. SAM is pacing
    around, raving.

</b><b>28  INT.   POSH RESTAURANT (ENTRANCE)        DAY             28
</b><b>    
</b>    The conversation between SAM and his MOTHER takes place
    while they are going through the sort of security checks
    familiar at airports. They are, however, just outside the
    velvet rope of the posh restaurant.
<b>

</b>                    (in full flow)
               Mr Helpmann was very close to your
               poor father. He was very close to me.
               Still is. He'll take you under his
               wing at Information Retrieval. You'll
               like it when you get there.

</b><b>                              SAM
</b>               You're not listening, mother.
<b>    
</b>    A warning buzzer goes off as MOTHER's handbag goes thru
    security check. It turns out to have been activated by a
    gaily wrapped package. A SECURITY GUARD relieves her of it
    and unwraps the package which contains the same kind of
    executive toy which we have seen twice before.
<b>    
</b><b>                            MOTHER
</b>               It's a present for my son.

<b>    
</b><b>                            MOTHER
</b>               I hope you like it. It's very

    looks disdainfully at SAM's unfashionable clerk's suite

</b>               Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
<b>    
</b>    SPIRO leads the way. SAM and his MOTHER follow, across the
    restaurant which is much like the Palm Court at the Plaza
    New York. Trellises, marble columns, antique mirroring,
    potted palms combine to impress us with their
    sophistication and taste. A string quartet can just be
    made out against the far wall. Except for the unfortunate
    intrusion of metal tubing and ducting brutally thrusting
    across areas of the ceiling, occasionally penetrating
    right through the middle of a particularly valuable-
    looking mirror, the general effect is one of confident
    wealth and breeding. SAM, MOTHER and MAITRE D make their
    way across the room. The waltzing strains of the string
    quartet accompanying them.
<b>    
</b>    CUT to group of tables with diners. At one of them sits a
    wealthy-looking OLDER WOMAN with a rather plain-looking
    DAUGHTER in her 20s. The OLDER WOMAN is easily
    distinguished from the other clientele by a large bandage
    that covers a goodish part of her head. The two of them
    (the MOTHER and DAUGHTER, not the MOTHER and bandage) are
    perusing the menus. SAM notes the DAUGHTER, unpleased.
<b>

    contains the same executive toy.

    lumps are the Identifying photographs on sticks stuck in
    each. The beautiful colour photos match the photos which
    were on the menus.

               for such wonderfully subtle shading,
               such delicate nuances - just like a

</b>    They are just about to dip into their respective splodges
    when there is a terrific explosion - a huge hole is
    blasted out of the wall to the kitchen. Chaos erupts
    around the carnage as WAITERS try putting out the flames
    with extinguishers. PEOPLE, bloody and dying, are moaning.
    The DINERS not actually affected by the blast look up for
    a moment and then, with a few raised eyebrows, go back to
    their meals.

</b><b>    
</b>    SAM as his dream-self rises INTO SHOT, his wings straining
    as he tows the floating cage imprisoning the GIRL. They
    are rising up and away from the monolithic stone
    skyscrapers that stretch away below them.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM
</b>               I'm taking you to a safe place. A
               place where they will never be able
               to get at us ... ever.
<b>    
</b>    An eyeball is scanning the sky. PULLING BACK we see it is
    but one of thousands, tightly packed side by side forming
    a landscape that extends as far as we can see. As SAM and
    the GIRL in her cage come into view it becomes apparent
    just how big these eyeballs are - they are gigantic -
    about 10 feet in diameter. All of them follow SAM as he
    comes to rest on a platform high atop a column that rises
    from the centre of this bizarre place.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM
</b>               There's no way they can approach us
               without being seen. You're safe here.
<b>    
</b>    He anchors the hawser holding the cage and takes off his
    wings. Just as he starts climbing up to the cage a
    terrific cracking noise is heard. SAM freezes.
<b>    
</b>    A dead straight crack is bisecting the sky from somewhere
    beyond the horizon - running right up the sky and over the
    camera. SAM follows it as it continues over the GIRL and
    down to the opposite horizon. Another crackling noise is
    heard. Another crack appears. Then another. And another.
    All these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point over
    the horizon. Soon the sky is covered with these cracks
    from horizon to foreground. Then cracks begin appearing at
    right angles to them. Very quickly the sky is covered with
    a mammoth grid. Once it is complete, another noise is
    heard. Something like massive blocks of stone sliding
    against one another. One of the squares formed by the grid
    pattern begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out
    from the back side of the sky. A square hole is left in
    its place. We can see the sides of the hole as it extends
    upwards into blackness. As soon as this first block of sky
    is withdrawn, another begins to slide up and away. SAM is
    frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on
    above him. The eyeballs are madly looking this way and
    that. The grinding noises are deafening as block after
    block of sky is removed. With each successive loss the
    light decreases. The GIRL is crying out for SAM to save
    her. Frantically SAM tries to haul the cage down to the
    platform but it's too late.
<b>    
</b>    Where the sky was is now pitch black. Only one block of
    sky remains. Slowly that final bit of sky is pulled up and
    out of shot. Total blackness. A maniacal laughter can be
    heard. A beam of light is switched on. SAM has a
    searchlight in his hand and is searching the darkness. The
    laughter continues. Suddenly the beam catches something
    black and moving. it's the same black, flapping cloth that
    appeared at the end of the previous dream. The horrible
    flapping thing comes thundering down on SAM.
<b>    
</b>    He is engulfed in the black awfulness.
<b>    
</b><b>30  INT. SAM'S BEDROOM                       NIGHT           30
</b><b>    
</b>    SAM is in bed, grappling with the bedclothes. He is
    dripping with sweat and screaming. The room is
    oppressively hot. He gets up and looks at the thermostat.
    It reads 99. He fumbles with it, but to no avail. It's
    stuck.
<b>    
</b>    CUT to SAM coming into the sitting room. He rushes over to
    the window and tries to open it. But it wasn't designed to
    be opened. Screws hold it firmly shut. SAM heads to the
    kitchen He finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the
    window. He swings the window open and takes a deep breath.
    GAG! COUGH! HACK! A terrible greeny-brown smog pours in
    through the window. Desperately SAM shuts the window and
    madly tightens up the screws. Swinging a newspaper, he
    tries clearing a path through the clouded atmosphere. He
    makes it to the front door and staggers out into the hall
    gasping for air.
    CUT to telephone being lifted from its cradle. Pull back
    as SAM with opened telephone directory in front of him
    dials. He is seated in his kitchen. In front of his open
    refrigerator. The phone rings at the other end.

</b>    SAM slams the phone down.
<b>    
</b>    CUT to SAM sitting in front of the refrigerator. The door
    is open and he has wedged a chair into the gap in a
    desperate bid to keep cool. He is nodding off. As his head
    slumps against one of the shelves, a jar of pickled onions
    falls to the floor. The onions scattering everywhere.
<b>    
</b><b>31  EXT.   DARKNESS                          NIGHT           31
</b><b>    
</b>    The milky white spheres tumble everywhere. But they are
    not onions, they are the giant eyeballs burtling through
    space. SAM is clinging desperately to one. He grabs the
    pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch
    cover. SAM manages to pull himself inside. Once out of the
    intergalactic maelstrom, SAM turns to survey the cramped
    and dark space inside the eyeball. It seems to be bisected
    by a dividing wall, from which a thin sliver of light is
    escaping. Pushing on the wall in the area of the slit, SAM
    is able to move a section. More light shaftes into the
    tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a
    small hatch. SAM scrunches down and really puts his
    shoulder to the hatch. with a metallic rasp it gives way
    and SAM crashes through.
<b>    
</b>    CUT to other side of opening as SAM topples through. He
    catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms
    back revealing his close call with disaster. He is high on
    a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets. The hatch
    he came through was the front of one of the millions of
    files-drawers composing this wall. As he scrambles back
    into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for
    hundreds of feet, disappear into a steaming mist. Other
    walls of files enclose this vast space. From where SAM is
    it looks like the view from the 50th storey of the Time
    Life building in NYC. These millions of files are being
    tended by MEN arising themselves up and down, as well as
    sideways, on modern skyscraper window-cleaners' platforms.
    The attendants are seen putting PEOPLE in different period
    costumes into drawers. SAM's attention is distracted by a
    sound overhead. Looking up he sees a window washer
    platform being lowered in his direction. Leaning over the
    side is a JOLLY GENT, who happens to look like MR HELPMANN
    (as seen on TV).

<b>    
</b>    The platform has stopped. The GENT pulls out a drawer. He
    reaches inside.
<b>    
</b>    The GENT pulls out a wonderful sword and helmet.
<b>    
</b><b>                             GENT
</b>               This is the Sword Of Truth ... and
               this the Helmet Of Justice.
<b>    
</b>    As SAM begins to strap on the weapon the GENT brings out a
    cape.
<b>    
</b><b>                             GENT
</b>               And this. completes the outfit.
<b>    
</b>    He puts the cape around SAM's shoulders and helps him step
    into the drawer. A moment's hesitation and then SAM outs
    the helmet on and lies down in the drawer. It fits just
    like a coffin.. As he lies back the GENT pushes the drawer
    in.
<b>    
</b><b>                             GENT
</b>               It won't be pleasant but, trust me.
<b>    
</b>    As the drawer is pushed in SAM suffers a sudden bout of
    claustrophobia. Looking up at the diministing opening he
    is surprised to see - not the face of the JOLLY GENT - but
    a terrifying SAMURAI WARRIOR's masked helmet. SAM
    struggles to prevent the drawer being closed.
<b>

</b>    SAM is grabbing the walls of the fridge. Water from the
    defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head. He wakes
    up. Before he can really take in where he is the phone
    rings. He staggers over to it.

</b>                    (into the phone)
               What? Who is this?
<b>    
</b>    SAM realises that the voice is also in the room behind
    him. He turns round and sees TUTTLE. TUTTLE is middle-
    aged, a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes
    suggesting a cross between a cat burglar and a night-raid
    commando. In one hand he holds a gun pointed at SAM. The
    other hand is holding a telephone receiver which TUTTLE is
    in the act of placing in the large capacious bag at his
    feet. SAM puts down his phone, and his hands up.
<b>    
</b><b>                            TUTTLE
</b>               Nice and easy now. Keep your hands

<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM

                    (indignantly)
               Who the hell are you?
<b>    
</b>    TUTTLE, keeping the gun on SAM, goes to different doors,
    leaning backwards into bedroom, bathroom and closet.
<b>    
</b>    TUTTLE suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun.
<b>    
</b><b>                            TUTTLE
</b>               Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At

<b>    
</b><b>                            TUTTLE

<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM
</b>               But ... I called Central Services.
<b>    
</b><b>                            TUTTLE
</b>               They're a bit overworked these days.
               Luckily I intercepted your call.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM
</b>               What?
<b>    
</b>    By now, BOTH are pouring with sweat.
    TUTTLE heads across the room and swiftly begins to undo a
    wall panel.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM
</b>               Wait a minute, what was that business
               with the gun?
<b>    
</b>    TUTTLE hands SAM the panel and plunges his arm into the
    space behind it.
<b>    
</b><b>                            TUTTLE
</b>               A little precaution, sir. I've had
               traps set for me before now. There
               are people in Central Services who'd
               love to get their hands on Harry
               Tuttle.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM
</b>               Are you saying this is illegal?
<b>    
</b>    By now TUTTLE has managed to pull out some sections of
    flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal
    behind the removed panel. It is all very complicated and
    greasy and it looks as though there is a lot more where
    that came from. TUTTLE is amazingly neat and deft as he
    works. A real pro. As he works he hums a wee tune ... yes
<b>    ... BRAZIL!!
</b><b>    
</b><b>                            TUTTLE
</b>               Well, yes ... and no. Officially,
               only Central Service operatives are
               supposed to touch this stuff ...
               Could you hold these.

</b><b>                            TUTTLE

</b>    He goes out closing the immediate door and goes to the
    front door which he opens. He is confronted by two
    officious little men in boiler suits who are standing
    outside his door. Their names are SPOOR and DOWSER. DOWSER
    is SPOOR's echo.

</b>    SAM tries to close the door but SPOOR prevents this.

               I think we'd better have a look.

<b>    
</b>    He is pushed aside. SPOOR followed by DOWSER, heads for
    the door behind which is MR TUTTLE. SAM is paralysed.
    SPOOR approaches the door as if it is dangerous. He turns
    the handle quietly and gives the door a little nudge. The
    door begins to swing slowly open. SAM suddenly finds
    inspiration.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM
</b>               Just a minute!
<b>    
</b>    SPOOR and DOWSER turn round as the door continues to swing
    open. When the door is open, behind their backs TUTTLE is
    seen holding his pistol in a two-handed grip, his knees
    slightly bent. TUTTLE freezes like that, pointing his
    pistol through the open door.

<b>                              SAM
</b>               Have you got a 27B/6?
<b>    
</b>    DOWSER looks very angry. Veins stand out on his forehead
    and he goes into what looks like some sort of fit. SPOOR
    knocks him to the ground.
<b>    
</b><b>                             SPOOR
</b>                    (to Sam)

    his gun.

    Tarzan-like off the end of the balcony and across a multi-

</b><b>    
</b>    Beautiful utopian block of high-rise flats gleam in the
    sunlight. Pulling back we reveal it to be an architect's
    model in a protective perspex case standing in the centre
    of a decorative fountain that has long ceased to work -
    graffiti and junk are now the only decorations. In the
    background is the grim reality of the massive housing
    tower. SAM's Messerschmidt is just puling up in the shadow
    of the building which is grey, decrepid, vandalised. Huge
    conduits, pipes, and tubing frame the scene. SAM gets out
    of the car under the cool and none-too-friendly gaze of a
    few LOCALS. Self-consciously, SAM looks around him, then
    at the paper in his hand. A little group of KIDS sit
    pitching pennies against a wall. SAM goes over to them.
<b>

<b>    
</b>    But before he can finish, the smallest, tiny KID looks up.

<b>    
</b>    SAM, uncomfortably, effs off.
<b>    
</b>    He is watched, at some distance, imapassively by the
    little GIRL BUTTTLE. As SAM enters the buildings one of
    the kids gets out a can of something and approaches the
    car. Another is fiddling, with a box of matches.

    of the big block of flats. Graffiti, vandalism are in
    evidence everywhere. He walks up to the lift. Pushes the
    button. Nothing happens. He pushes again. This time the
    lift door shudders and sparks. SAM tries to pull the doors
    apart. They jam open with a three-inch gap between them -
    still shuddering and grinding. In the sparking light, SAM
    can make out an interior crammed with garbage, junk, old
    furniture, dead cats. Yechhhh. Resignedly, he turns
    towards the stairs.

</b>    CUT to SAM coming breathlessly out of the stairwell. On
    the wall next to it is the number 37. Walking down the
    corridor he looks at the number and starts to knock, but
    then notices that the door is cracked open. SAM tries to
    knock on the door, but it keeps edging open and he settles
    for knocking on the door frame a bit feebly.

    SAM pushes the door a bit more open gingerly and puts
    about 65 per cent of his body into the hall of the flat.

    in half-darkness. This is the same flat from which the
    FATHER was taken at the beginning of the film: the hole is
    still in the ceiling. SAM becomes aware of a woman sitting
    absolutely still at a small table by the only (still
    broken) window in the room.

</b><b>                              SAM

    she fails to notice it - or him for that matter. SAM
    pushes the cheque a little way towards MRS BUTTLE but she

               overcharged by Information Retrieval.
               I don't think they usually make
               mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose
               we're all human.
<b>    
</b>    SAM looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling.
<b>    
</b>               Oh ... what happened to the ...?
<b>    
</b>    He gets nothing back.
<b>    
</b>               Actually, my bringing this here is
               rather unorthodox ... Usually any
               payments are made through the central
               computer ... but, er ... there were
               certain difficulties, and rather than
               cause delay, we thought you might
               appreciate this now ... it being
               Christmas.

               Ministry is always very scrupulous
               about following up and eradicating
               error. If you have any complaints
               which you'd like to make, I'd be more
               than happy to send you the

</b>    MRS BUTTLE starts to cry.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM
</b>               Look, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid
               I don't know anything about it ...
               I'm really just delivering the
               cheque. Er ... If you wouldn't mind
               signing these receipts

                    receipts)
               I'll go and leave you in peace.
<b>    
</b>    SAM picks up the cheque and gives it to MRS BUTTLE
    together with the receipts. MRS BUTTLE tears them up and
    throws them in his face.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM

               good ... What have you done with his
               body?
<b>    
</b>    SAM looks around for an escape and sees a YOUNG BUTTLE
    standing in the doorway. The BOY is looking at him with a
    blank tearful face. Suddenly the BOY launches himself at
    SAM with terrible ferocity. SAM is knocked against the
    wall. A mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the
    floor. The BOY is all over SAM kicking and pulling his
    hair. MRS BUTTLE's reaction, however, is to try and pull
    the BOY away from SAM. By the time she succeeds, SAM is on
    his hands and knees, in pain. The BOY is crying and
    shouting, and MRS BUTTLE is loudly trying to quieten the
<b>    BOY.
</b><b>    
</b>    From SAM'S POV, a piece of broken mirror lying on the
    floor reflects the hole in the ceiling ... with JILL's
    head and shoulders framed in the hole. The moment is
    unreal for SAM in his dazed condition. The vision seems
    unreal too. JILL is staring at SAM out of the piece of
    mirror and. she's very much the GIRL from his dream now.

<b>    
</b>    SAM grabs at the image, i.e. at the mirror, shifting the
    angle so that the vision disappears. He looks for the
    vision on the floor but can't find it. Then he begins to
    realise the reality of what he has seen. He stands up,
    dazed and battered. MRS BUTTLE has been looking up at the
    ceiling. SAM looks up at the ceiling but there is now only
    the empty space of the hole.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM

</b>    MRS BUTTLE is shouting. SAM rushes out of the flat.

    himself in -

</b>    He runs along the corridor but has omitted to count the
    doors downstairs and now doesn't know which door to knock
    at. He hesitates. He rings the bell on what he hopes is
    the right door. The bell doesn't work. He bangs on the
    door. The door opens a crack. A malevolent eye looks at
    him.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM

</b><b>    
</b>    SAM bursts into JILL's flat. He sees the hole in the
    floor. The place looks derelict. He hears an explosion and
    looks out of a window to see his car in flames. JILL is
    apparently retreating from it across the forecourt. She is
    carrying a suitcase and bundles.

</b>    SAM charges out into the open air. JILL has disappeared.
    The Messerchmidt, however, is in flames. SAM doesn't know
    which way to turn. Spotting an old mattress lying by the
    building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an
    attempt to smother the flames. The group of CHILDREN watch
    him silently. Suddenly with a great roar, JILL's lorry
    comes round the corner at speed. SAM sees that JILL is at
    the wheel. SAM runs after the lorry.

<b>    
</b>    The lorry roars away. SAM dashes back to his smoldering
    three-wheeler. He flings himself into it and starts it up.
    He also roars away, except that he doesn't move... all
    three wheels have been removed. He turns round in despair
    and sees the group of CHILDREN regarding him
    expressionlessly.
<b>    
</b>    They include the little GIRL BUTTLE.
<b>    
</b>    Defeated, he slumps down against his charred vehicle. A
    shadow passes across his face. Looking up he sees GIRL
    BUTTLE standing over him.

<b>    
</b>    GIRL BUTTLE doesn't answer and SAM starts to walk away.
    After a few yards, the thought strikes him: he turns back
    to look at the little GIRL BUTTLE who stands alone
    patiently in the vandalised wilderness.

</b>    It is the end of the work day. The CLERKS are busily
    getting their coats and leaving the office. As the last
    one goes MR. KURTZMAN comes out of his private office with
    his hat and coat on. He turns out the office light. He
    sees SAM isolated in the empty room, still working at his

<b>    
</b>    SAM doesn't seem to hear him. On the computer screen is a
    front and side view picture of JILL. Her name and code
    number is at the top of the screen. SAM is punching up
    personal dossier information like "age", "height",
    "weight", "colour of hair", "colour of eyes",
    "distinguishing marks" etc.

               tomorrow -
<b>

               I shall probably have nightmares.

</b>    At this point the word "Classified" superimposes itself
    over most of the screen and "IRQ/3" starts agitating at

<b>    
</b>    Throughout this verbal wallpaper SAM has been punching
    keys cancelling the CLASSIFIED overprint. He then punches
    in the code for a hard-copy print-out. JILL's two-view

</b>    KURTZMAN picks up JILL's print-out and glances at it. He
    grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder.

<b>    
</b>    SAM nods. He turns off the machine. He stands up and
    follows KURTZMAN towards the door. The door is some
    distance away, and before they get there all the lights go
    out. KURTZMAN bumps into a desk and curses.

    drawing long flowing hair with a pencil on the computer

    of SAM's corridor. Passengers disembark and head for
    various doors along the corridor. SAM almost fails to get
    off in time - so concentrated on JILL's picture is he.
    Looking as if he's trying to make up his mind about
    something he heads for his own front door.

</b><b>    
</b>    SAM enters. The place is in a state of turmoil. Servicing
    panels are off the walls. Conduit, ducting, pipes, unknown
    mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was
    disemboweled. SPOOR stands in the middle of it all trying
    to direct two other WORKMEN who are poring over wiring
    plans which seem to make little sense to them. DOWSER is
    not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and
    banging going on somewhere behind the wall.

<b>    
</b>    For reply SPOOR whips a small tape-recorder out of his bag
    and plays back SAM's original phone call to Central
    Services, claiming "an emergency". SPOOR shuts off his
    machine, puts back into his bag and comes out with what
    looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper
    between each page. SPOOR indicates the bottom of page 1.

</b>    DOWSER bursts through a panel in the wall. This is the
    panel which TUTTLE had removed and replaced. A few of the
    flat's intestines have come out with DOWSER. DOWSER has
    made a find - TUTTLE's spare part.

    out of SAM's hands, rips out the last page, thrusts that

    ruins of his flat.
<b>    
</b>    SAM stands in the maimed sitting-room. Wall panels are
    off. Tubes, ducting wires etc. spill out into the room
    like greasy intestines. SAM more or less collapses onto a
    couch. He stares at the ceiling. The room is gently
    hiccoughing and belching around him. He stares at the
    print-out of JILL's face. Slowly it dissolves into the
<b>    DREAM GIRL.

</b><b>    
</b>    DREAM GIRL's face fills screen. The camera pulls back to
    reveal that she is separated from us by a tangled forest
    of conduit/ducting-like vines. SAM is struggling through
    the vines, which grab at him, entwine and entangle him.
    Finally bursting free he reaches out for the GIRL hovering
    before him, But as he embraces her she dissolves in smoke
    and he plummet into a void beneath his feet.

</b><b>    
</b><b>52  EXT.   CLOUDS                            NIGHT           52
</b><b>    
</b>    CUT to SAM plummeting down through dense clouds, his cape
    twisting around him. Somehow he manages to wrestle it
    clear of his body. Gripping the corners he whips the cape
    up and over his head. The wind catches it and fills it out
    until it acts as a parachute slowing SAM's descent.
    Suddenly the clouds thin out and SAM can see below him.
<b>    
</b><b>    
</b><b>53  EXT.   STRANGE LANDSCAPE                 ANTI-DAY        53
</b><b>    
</b>    SAM is heading down towards a barren landscape. Strange
    mounds dot the barrenness - they ooze smoke and the
    occasional flame. Near one of the mounds are two long
    lines of shrouded FIGURES being forced into two giant
    cages, suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons. The
    black-robed FORCES OF DARKNESS (FOD) surround the
    PRISONERS, relentlessly herding them towards the cages.
    The entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light.
    The sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a
    black disc. SAM descends on his cape-parachute.
<b>    
</b>    CUT to PRISONERS in their grey shrouds, shuffling towards
    the jaws of the brutal cages. They are defeated,
    destroyed, without hope. The FOD prod and whip them
    forward. One of the FOD raises his spear to force a
    stumbling PRISONER to his feet but stops with the spear
    raised above his head. He has seen something. Other FODS
    turn to see what it is. CUT to SAM landing on the beach -
    a short distance away. The PRISONERS stop and look up. We
    see their faces clearly for the first time. One of them is
    MRS BUTTLE. Others are PEOPLE SAM saw in the flats, and
    the KIDS. SAM recognises them. He is slightly taken aback.
    A look of determination crosses his face. He draws the
    sword. EVERYONE is frozen in place. SAM starts forward.
    But he is stopped by a violent tremor as the earth begins
    to tremble and shake. EVERYONE looks terrified. With a
    mighty roar a crack opens up in the ground between SAM and
    the OTHERS. Brilliant rays of light shaft upwards from the
    opening. And then, with a maniacal shriek, the large black
    flapping thing shoots out of the crevasse and streaks high
    into the sky. SAM hesitates and turns to look down into
    the light. There, under several meters of the earth's
    crust are fluffy white clouds darting about in a beautiful
    blue sky. SAM is delighted but as he looks up he is frozen
    in his tracks by an enormous FIGURE that straddles the
    crevasse. This terrifying CREATURE stands over 12 feet
    high. He is encased in a frightening concoction of ancient
    Japanese armour which seems on closer examination to he
    made of computer parts. His face is hidden behind a
    horrific steel mask. It is the GIANT SAMURAI WARRIOR that
    was pushing the drawer closed in the Storeroom Of
    Knowledge. In his hand is an evil-looking spear. SAM is
    unsure which way to turn. The GREY PRISONERS are being
    loaded into the cages with more speed. He turns to face
    the GIANT WARRIOR. As SAM steps forward the GIANT stands
    ominously still. Then very slowly he raises his spear in
    an almost religious gesture. POOF! He vanishes. As he does
    the light from the day is cut off. Looking down, SAM sees
    that he crevasse has vanished as well. Maniacal laughter
    from the flapping black thing makes SAM look up to see the
    ballooned cage packed with GREY PRISONERS rise up from the
    ground and begin to float away escorted by the Black
    flapping Thing. SAM rushes after it grabbing one of the
    trailing ropes. But as he is hoisted into the air it is
    severed by the FODS. He tumbles to the ground. Looking
    around he sees that, for some reason, the second ballooned
    cage is still tethered nearby. SAM rushes over to it and
    begins chopping the tethers away.
    The cage bobbles ungainlily as SAM cuts the last
    restraining rope. Grabbing hold he is pulled upwards, but
    before he can reach the cage something clutches his leg
    halting his progress. As he struggles his other leg is
    caught. He is being pulled back by two giant hands.
    Looking down he can see that from the top of one of the
    smoking mounds a head and two giant arms protrude. The
    face looks like MR KURTZMAN. SAM desperately clings on to
    the rope as he struggles with the restraining hands.
<b>    
</b><b>                   MR KURTZMAN OF THE MOUND
</b>               Don't go! It's a trap! She's not what
               she seems.

</b>    SAM kicks and strains but the hands hold firm.

</b><b>    
</b>    SAM wakes up. His feet are entangled in some wiring and
    ducting. He is still in his devastated sitting room. As he
    untangles himself the door bell rings. It takes a moment
    for SAM to recognise it as the door bell. Annoyed and
    still disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the
    door. He opens it. In bursts a GIRL dressed in a silly
    bell-boy costume with lots of glitter, net stockings and
    big-bowed tap dancing shoes. She launches into a terrible
    song and dance routine.

</b><b>    
</b>    SAM rings the doorbell to his mother's flat. He is
    wearing. an unstylish tuxedo and bow tie - obviously his
    only dress outfit. The door is opened by a LIVERIED FLUNKY
    who's about to speak when an attractive 40-year old
    woman's face appears over his shoulder and addresses SAM
    over the threshold.
<b>

</b><b>    
</b>    SAM steps inside, where the flunky proceeds to search him.
    The place is full of sleek people - smartly but less
    formally dresses than SAM. It is an elegant baroque room -
    lavishly appointed but still violated by the ubiquitous
    Central Service ducts that thrust through antique
    tapestries and gilt mirrors with little regard for
    aesthetics or the interior decorator's feelings.

               Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The
               bandages came of this afternoon. Come

    suddenly freezes - the reflection in the large wall mirror
    next to him is not that of the party guests - but of the

</b>    SAM steps out of the lift.The lift doors close. SAM looks
    up and down the corridor hearing nothing. Silence. Then
    he, and we, begin to hear a sound. It is a curious
    whirring murmuring tummeling sound, and it seems to be
    growing closer. Suddenly a scrum of PEOPLE swings into
    view around a corner at the far end of the rather long
    corridor. At the centre of the scrum is a TALL MAN with a
    magisterial expression and an air of eternal bustle. This
    is MR WARREN. He is surrounded by the EXPEDITERS who are
    competing for his attention with bits of paper and bits of
    sentences. MR WARREN is snapping out decisions. Satisfied
    EXPEDITERS drop out of the scrum at intervals,
    disappearing one at a time through one of the many doors
    which line both sides of the corridor.The scrum doesn't
    get any smaller because new EXPEDITERS dart out of other
    doors and join the milling MOB. The whole circus is coming
    by SAM at the rate of knots. The sound it makes breaks
    down into something like this.

<b>    
</b>    SAM doesn't have the nerve to jump into this. The scrum
    sweeps by and fades away along the corridor, and finally
    disappearing around the corner at the other end. SAM
    follows. Silence has descended again.

    corridor at right angles. He hesitates and continues. Then
    he starts to hear the sound again. It is coming up from
    behind. MR WARREN has circumnavigated the building. The
    same sort of business is being enacted at the same pace.

    the direction they came from plus a bit.
<b>

    leaving SAM standing dumfounded at the entrance to his
    office.
<b>    
</b>    CUT to SAM's POV of the office. It is about four feet
    wide. A small blacked-out window high on the far wall is
    bisected by what looks like a recently constructed side
    wall. The room is bare except for a chair and a desk which
    is also bisected by the new wall. Pneumatic tubes hang
    from the ceiling. SAM slowly enters the room.

</b><b>    
</b>    SAM looks lost ... disoriented. He doesn't know where to
    begin because there's nothing to begin with. He squeezes
    in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do
    starts arranging his "in" and "out" baskets. There in his
    "in" basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys -
    gaily wrapped with a card from HELPMANN - Merry Xmas &amp;
    Welcome. SAM can't quite believe. He returns to lining up
    his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books)
    against the wall on the left extreme of his desk. SAM
    turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they
    both fall over with a "plop". Puzzled, he stands the books
    up again, turns his eyes away and "plop". Same result.
    Intrigued, a bit exasperated, SAM carefully, and before
    his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall,
    and "plop", the books topple over. Puzzled, SAM grabs hold
    of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the
    wall. The desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops,
    somehow held stubbornly. SAM grits his teeth, reallllly
    pulls, grimacing a bit, but the desk won't budge.
    Intrigued, SAM gets up, goes around his desk and heads for
    the door.

    walking to the next door, the nameplate of which reads:

    the other half of his room bisected by the partition wall.
    The other half of his desk is occupied by a slimy looking,
    round-headed little JUNIOR EXECUTIVE wholly occupied with
    trying to drag a bit more of the desk into his office. He
    is unaware of SAM.

</b><b>

    one finger exercise which is going on next door. He stares
    dumbly at the shining, absolutely useless, executive toy.

</b><b>65  EXT.   ICY SEA                           ANTI-DAY        65
</b><b>    
</b>    The CAMERA skims along over an icy sea. This is SAM'S POV
    as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming
    wings. In the distance rises a strange massive ship.
<b>    
</b>    As he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing
    heavily to one side. In fact it is barely afloat. Closer
    still, it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone.
    Dark, evil, grey blocks of granite form not only the hull,
    but the super-structures and smokestacks. It looks like a
    massive medieval fortress gone to sea. The screen is
    engulfed in stone. The CAMERA heads up the side of the
    ship. Higher and higher we climb - past course after
    course of mammoth stones. Reaching the first deck, we
    continue upwards. There appears to be no entrance. SAM is
    looking frustrated and angry. But then he spots an
    opening. A few stones have come loose - one of them juts
    out forming a ledge. As the cage passes, SAM jumps and
    managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping. Squeezing
    thru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark
    passage. Emerging from the opening he finds himself
    teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull
    and the inner stone core of the ship. Great stone ribs
    curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow
    shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks
    and fissures in the stone core. For a brief moment SAM
    gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but
    his attention is distracted by a distant moan. Huddled far
    below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of
    grey shrouded PRISONERS. Their moan blends with the creaks
    and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back
    and forth. Suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the
    ship. SAM is unsure where it comes from. And then another
    boom reverberates about him. He has to steady himself as
    the ship quivers from the noise. Another book. He clutches
    at the wall.

</b>    SAM's head is leaning against the wall of his office. The
    boom repeats. LIME is knocking on the other side. SAM
    leaps up. As he leaves his office he looks back to see the
    desk creep through to LIME's office a little bit more.

<b>    
</b>    The cavalcade is passing the lifts. SAM backs away into
    the open lift. The cavalcade passes on out of sight. The
    lift contains a CHARLADY with a bucket and mop. She
    remains in the lift as SAM joins her.

    close on him and the CHARLADY. From somewhere far away
    there is the groaning shriek of a man in pain. SAM glances
    around the lift. There appears to be an air conditioning
    vent in the ceiling.
<b>    
</b>    SAM glances enquiringly at the CHARLADY who merely smiles
    at him. Another scream is heard.

<b>    
</b>    The CHARLADY smiles again.
<b>    
</b>               Doesn't that disturb you?
<b>    
</b>    The CHARLADY fiddles with something in her ears and pulls
    out a pair of wax earplugs.

    the lift. The doors close. SAM heads down surgically clean
    white-tiled corridor.
<b>    
</b>    Passing a white-coated TECHNICIAN monitoring what appears
    to be electric meters, SAM comes to a door with 5001.
    Above the door a red light is glowing. SAM knocks. The red
    light goes out and a green light comes on. SAM enters.

<b>    
</b>    Inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but
    the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant-
    looking FEMALE typist, wearing headphones, chewing gum and
    typing with great facility. SAM approaches the TYPIST who,
    busily typing, twinkles a greeting (mimed) and silently
    mouths the words ...
<b>    
</b><b>                            TYPIST

<b>                    
</b>    SAM nods, and stands quietly by her. He can hear tiny
    sounds coming through her headphones. He looks down at the
    piece of paper in the typewriter. He reacts a bit
    strangely, perhaps even winces. We see he close up of the
    words being struck crisply on paper.

<b>    
</b>    She is looking at SAM helpfully, holding one of the
    earphones away from her ear. From this earphone we can
    just hear quietly ...

</b>    The TYPIST nods smiling. She puts back the earphone and
    carries on typing.
<b>    
</b><b>                            TYPIST
</b>               I'm sure he won't be long now.
<b>    
</b>    She types a little more but suddenly stops.
<b>    
</b>                         I thought so!
<b>    
</b>    She takes off the earphones and takes the paper and
    carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all
    the different copies.
<b>    
</b>    Through the frosted glass door leading into the next area,
    SAM can see a FIGURE come through a double door and turn
    left, making a silly 'hi' sign to the TYPIST as he exits
    from sight. She is charmed. Almost immediately after them,
    a white-coated TECHNICIAN exits, but to the left.
<b>

</b><b>    
</b>    SAM goes through the glass door and is about to push open
    the double doors in front of him. He is halted by a noise
    from the TYPIST - she indicates that he is to go to the
    left. He does so and enters an office. An antique desk
    with a large collection of executive toys and other
    tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a
    rather oddly shaped ... distorted as it by the curved wall
    of the much larger room that SAM was stopped from
    entering. Nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently
    successful. A buzzing noise draws SAM's attention to the
    wash basin in the far corner. The Information Retrieval
    TECHNICIAN is standing by a sink massing his temples with
    old-fashioned scalp vibrators. His back to us.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM
</b>               Excuse me. Are you officer 412/L?
<b>    
</b>    The TECHNICIAN makes no sign of having heard this. He
    continues vibrating his temples.

</b><b>                              SAM
</b>                    (a bit louder)
               Er, excuse me!
<b>    
</b>    Getting no response SAM walks over to the TECHNICIAN. As
    he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face
    down on the desk top. It seems strangely familiar - but as
    it is a negative concave image SAM isn't sure. He
    continues over to the TECHNICIAN.

<b>    
</b>    He touches the TECHNICIAN on the shoulder, who jumps with
    a start. He spins around and turns out to be none other
    than JACK LINT. He is amazed to see SAM.

</b><b>                             JACK
</b>               OK. OK. Let's not fence around ...
               This is the situation. Some idiot
               somewhere in the building, some
               insect, confused two of our clients,
               B58/732 and T47/215.

               Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
<b>    
</b><b>                             JACK
</b>               Well, your A. Buttle has been
               confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle.
               I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should
               be shot for that. So B58/732 was
               pulled in by mistake.

</b><b>                              SAM

</b><b>                             JACK
</b>                    (a little heated)
               I did not get the wrong man. I got
               the right man. The wrong man was
               delivered to me as the right man! I
               accepted him, on trust, as the right
               man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to
               the confusion, he died on us. Which,
               had he been the right man, he
               wouldn't have done.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM

               Sam, there are very rigid parameters
               laid down to avoid that event but
               Buttle's heart condition did not
               appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think
               I'm dismissing this business, Sam.
               I've lost a week's sleep over it
               already.
<b>

</b>               There are some real bastards in this
               department who don't mind breaking a
               few eggs to make an omelette, but
               thank God there are the new boys like
               me who want to maintain decent
               civilized standards of terrorist
               eradication. We've got the upper hand
               for the moment, but they're waiting
               for us to slip up, and a little slip-
               up like this is just the chance
               they're looking for.

<b>    
</b><b>                             JACK
</b>               What I've got to do now is pick up
               Tuttle, interrogate him at the same
               voltage as Buttle, to the same meter
               reading to the last penny, and juggle
               the books in electrical banking.
<b>    
</b><b>                              SAM
</b>               What has Tuttle done?
<b>    
</b><b>                             JACK
</b>               We suspect him of freelance
               subversion.

</b><b>                              SAM
</b>                    (dumbly)
               He's a freelance subversive?
<b>    
</b><b>                             JACK
</b>               He's a compulsive heating engineer. A
               maverick ex-Central Service repair
               man with a grudge against society.
               Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of
               the wood, I think. At least we will
               be when I get this Layton woman under
               arrest.

    echoing through the massive lobby. He looks in the
    direction of the porters desk. There stands JILL arguing
    with the PORTER.
<b>    
</b><b>                             JILL
</b>               But you've stamped this form before!
               Why won't you stamp it now?
<b>    
</b><b>                            PORTER
</b>               You've just said yourself, Miss,
               we've already stamped it. Why should
               we stamp it twice?
<b>    
</b>    SAM is frozen. He can't believe what he sees. The lift
    doors close. SAM is too slow to stop them. Madly he pushes
    the buttons - to no effect. The lift descends. (At this
    point we had better describe the lift. It is a cross
    between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille
    doors and the super-sleek modern lifts that rise and fall
    in glass tubes so that one can have panoramic views of
    dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the
    Ministry.)
<b>    
</b>    SAM can see JILL and if JILL were to look up she could see
    SAM descending. He is shouting and rattling the bars of
    the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention.
    SAM sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying
    to stop the demon lift. From his POV we see JILL
    disappearing from view still arguing with the PORTER.

</b><b>    
</b>    The lift comes to rest. SAM is still trying to get it to
    respond and return him to the lobby. TWO TECHNICIANS are
    waiting as the doors open. From SAM's POV he sees them
    hang a sign on the door and walk away. He bangs the
    buttons for another moment with no result. He looks out of
    the lift and is able to read the sign - "LIFT OUT OF
    ORDER". Frantically he looks around for another lift. All
    the others are on distant floors - then he spots one off
    to one side, its doors standing open. Rushing over to it
    he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number - but
    there are no numbers on the buttons, only letters. Before
    he can sort this out a voice shouts at him.

    wearing his new I.D. badge. The GUARD can't see it because
    JILL's dossier is covering it.

    GUARDS are responding as trained. The GUARDS chasing him
    screech to a halt when they see the others snapping to

    glaring at him and pointing to a "Keep your city tidy"

    papers. The LADY continues screaming at him, her little
    Pekinese dog (who incidentally wears a plaster over his
    bum hole) yaps at his ankles, ripping SAM's new trousers.
    SAM is torn between trying to regain the pages of the
    dossier and following JILL who has disappeared round the

    a solid wall of giant bill-boards, advertising all sorts
    of wonders like pine scented lavatory paper, sea spray
    flavored cigarettes - you name it - These advertisements

</b>    The power plant is an extensive, brutal, Dante's Inferno
    of a landscape made mainly of steel ... towers, chimneys,
    huge pipes, buildings which look like bomb shelters ... It
    is still daylight but the whole scene is murky and
    forbidding because of the swirling steam and smoke. In the
    murk can be seen sinister-looking FIGURES in protective
    clothing and hard hats.
<b>    
</b>    This is the world which is now entered by JILL's lorry ...
    The lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and
    JILL jumps down from the cab. SAM stays inside, looking
    around. Something catches his eye.
<b>    
</b>    CUT to facade of house. Window boxes with flowers and
    shrubbery surrounded by a white picket fence provide
    domestic charm, however, in the doorway stands a MAN with
    protective clothing and something like a gas-mask over his
    face. He is waving to someone. Slowly the house rises out
    of frame.
<b>    
</b>    In a WIDER SHOT we can see the house is suspended from and
    a giant crane that swings it through the air - air filled
    with stead, smoke, evil-smelling fumes. It is lowered onto
    the back of a lorry and we can see that the house is one
    of many prefabricated houses used in the construction of
    the power plant.

</b><b>    
</b>    SAM watches JILL walk away from the lorry and enter the
    despatcher's hut. He looks around uneasily and then he
    start examining the inside of the lorry and opens a
    compartment which seems to be full of maps, rags, etc. He
    gets grease on sleeve of his suit. In the space behind the
    seats he finds the pieces of luggage which JILL had
    carried away from the flat. He starts to examine this
    cautiously and is startled by the sudden opening of the
    cab door.

</b>    The lorry stops and JILL gets out. From SAM'S P.O.V., the
    house suspended from the crane starts moving through the
    sky towards the lorry. He glances back to see JILL slip a
    package out from behind the seat. She glances
    surreptitiously over her shoulder and slipping the parcel
    inside her jacket she walks away.

    JILL. He ends up standing next to a rusty Kodak Photospot
    standard. The picture on it - though faded by pollution -
    is of the beautiful valley that has now been replaced by
    the murk and mess of the power plant. JILL has made her
    way over to a rather SHADOWY FIGURE lurking around the
    corner of one of the metal structures. They appear to be
    exchanging parcels. SAM is worried by this suspicious
    behaviour - reinforced as it is by a Ministry poster on
    the side of the building that illustrates, almost
    identically, the action we have just seen along with the
    warning: "MIND THAT PARCEL. EAGLE EYES CAN SAVE A LIFE".

    airfield out to the use of a vast open air warehouse whose
    contents is arranged in a grid pattern of "streets", all
    the streets being lined by stacks, piles, ranks, jumbles
    of goods and objects which seem at first to be arbitrarily
    grouped, some of them (like the stacks of prefabricated
    houses) standing in the open others protected under simple
    areas of roofing. Each group of Assorted Supplies lies
    inside the squares of the grid of streets. The streets are
    eerily lit by lights just being switched on, and each
    square is also lit by harsh localized lighting. The effect
    is a nightmarish gigantic Aladdin's cave of black shadows
    and garishly lit mountains of stuff.

</b>    From behind the DRIVER we can see that the house has
    settled across the roadway at right-angle to the other
    houses, making it appear to be a normal dead end street.
    So shocked is the DRIVER that he fails to stop in time and
    KABLOW!! the car smashes into the house.

</b>    A Security vehicle in full banshee howl roars through the
    streets. We roar along with it as it rounds a corner and
    skids to a halt at a safe but striking distance from
    JILL's lorry. Heavily armed SECURITY POLICE pour out and
    take up firing positions behind parked cars or whatever
    other cover is available. Searchlights are played on the
    lorry. The OFFICER IN CHARGE appears with a loud-hailer.
<b>    
</b><b>                       OFFICER IN CHARGE
</b>               Come out, we know you're in there!
               You cannot possibly escape. Throw
               your weapons from your vehicle and
               come out slowly with your hands on
               your heads. Obey my instructions and
               no harm will come to you. But if you
               force us to shoot we'll shoot to
               kill.
<b>    
</b>    During the above speech a SMALL BOY on a tricycle "roars"
    around a corner behind the SECURITY POLICE. He rides into
    a gap between them, rolls his tricycle over and "takes
    cover" behind it. He points his toy rifle at JILL's lorry
    and takes shot. In reaction to the noise made by the kid's
    rifle the OFFICER IN CHARGE dives for cover and the
    SECURITY TROOPS open fire and pepper JILL's lorry cab with
    holes. A few of the SECURITY TROOPS then rush forward and
    fling open the cab door. The cab is empty. The OFFICER IN
    CHARGE gets to his feet and looks about. His uniform is
    covered with dust, oil and shit from the street. He just
    misses seeing the back of the BOY as he disappears round
    the corner on his tricycle.

</b>    To the lush sound of musak we glide through the glittering
    sensuous, supportive world of ladies undergarments. As we
    slip past girdles, bras, panti-hose for a variety of
    exotic occasions we come upon SAM and JILL pushing a
    shopping trolley. In the trolley is the "suspicious"

               No you're not!
<b>    
</b>    They start an ugly little struggle for the parcel. SAM's
    suit gets slightly ripped. Their tug-of-war is interrupted
    by a voice off camera.

    away. MRS TERRAIN is heavily bandaged and sitting in a
    wheelchair which SHIRLEY is pushing.
<b>    
</b><b>                          MRS TERRAIN

<b>    
</b>    From the TERRAINS' POV SAM looks as if he is wrestling
    with a dummy, or with himself if he is beside a full
    length mirror. The mirror or something obscures JILL. MRS
    TERRAIN and SHIRLEY exchange puzzled looks and proceed
    toward SAM.

    with strategic holes in them.

<b>    
</b>    At this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far
    corner of the store. It is the corner that we last saw
    JILL moving towards. SAM races towards the smoke, dust
    covering his suit. He finds bras, knickers, broken shop
    dummies, bleeding CUSTOMERS and SHOP ASSISTANTS all over
    the place. On the edge of this devastated area he sees
    JILL struggling out from under a pile of negligees and
    plaster dust. He rushes over to her.

<b>    
</b>    She has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it
    open. Under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured.
    Christmas packages - yes you guessed it - executive toys.
    She throws the parcel and its contents hard into SAM's
    chest. He topples back-wards - tangling himself up with
    the severed limbs of a shop dummy.
<b>    
</b><b>                             JILL

               for official ass-holes like you!
<b>    
</b>    SAM sits in the debris - ashamed and relieved. Liquor
    oozes from the broken bottle all over SAM's suit. He is at
    a loss for words.
<b>    
</b>    JILL's attention is attracted by moans coming from the
    badly hurt BOMB VICTIMS. She goes to help them.
<b>    
</b><b>                             JILL

               are people hurt!
<b>               
</b>    JILL goes around trying to make the INJURED comfortable.
    SAM follows her. He takes off his jacket with his
    Information Retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to
    make a pillow for one of these VICTIMS. By now sirens are
    wailing, water sprinklers are functioning, and there is
    general pandemonium. SECURITY GUARDS run into the area and
    begin arresting everyone, including the DEAD and INJURED.
    ONE OF THE GUARDS tries to drag off the WOMAN whom JILL is
    attending.
<b>    
</b><b>                             JILL
</b>               Hey stop ... she's hurt!
<b>    
</b>    The GUARD gives JILL a thump in the side of the face with
    his gloved hand. SAM sees red.

</b><b>    
</b>    The GUARD looks up and as he does so he is transformed
    into the GIANT WARRIOR from SAM's dream. He towers over
    the WOUNDED, the DYING and the debris of the blasted
    lingerie department. SAM grabs for a weapon and comes up
    with one of the arms (now detached) of the shop dummy. It
    makes a passable club.
<b>

    ... a chink in the other's defences - at which point SAM
    is flattened from behind by a TROOPER's gun butt.

    tumbles end over end - unable to stop his crashing
    descent. With a thud he hits the bottom. Stunned, bruised
    and battered he tries to get up. Standing over him are the
    GREY PRISONERS. They press forward.

    mumbling ... the only BAGGEE in the wagon apart from TWO

</b>    SAM recovers consciousness to find himself sitting at his
    desk in his office. He is bruised and battered and has a
    black eye. His suit is torn and bloody. MR WARREN is
    gripping him by the throat and giving him a lecture.
    Behind WARREN, crowding the doorway, are the PEOPLE who
    circulate around him and are the cast of the WARREN high
    energy circus. LIME is with them.

    glances at it.

               it.

</b>    He slams the form down onto the desk which is covered with
    other forms.
<b>    
</b>               And what the hell is this mess? An
               empty desk is an efficient desk.
<b>    
</b>    He has picked up some of the forms.

    off with his ENTOURAGE, leaving a gleeful LIME in the

    locked his door. SAM bangs on the door.

<b>    
</b>    SAM storms back into his office. Reaching a peak of
    frustration, he stuffs all his paperwork into the
    pneumatic tube and sends it off into oblivion. Within
    seconds it returns. SAM sends it off a second time. It
    doesn't return a second time, periodically something
    passes through the tubes causing them to move. SAM's
    pneumatic tubes continue to pulsate, pressure building up.
    At this point SAM's desk begins, as before, to creep
    through the wall. He grabs it violently. He pulls it.
    There is a scream from the other side of the wall. SAM
    smiles. Th pneumatic tubes give a final convulsion and
    then there appears to be a muffled explosion outside SAM's
    office door. It shakes the whole building. SAM goes to his
    door and opens it.

    occupants of the room. All the occupants stick their heads
    into the corridor, all gazing with SAM at the variously
    coloured blizzard of paper which has errupted through the
    whole length of the corridor ceiling, from which protrudes
    the intestines of the pneumatic system.

</b><b>                       BUILDING
</b><b>    
</b>    SAM is leaving the Ministry of Information Retrieval. The
    lights in the foyer are blazing behind him, the street
    lamps are lit. He is exhausted and depressed and anxious
    about the safety and whereabouts of Jill. He begins to
    retrace their first journey together, down the Ministry
    front steps and around the corner to where Jill's truck
    was parked.

<b>    
</b>    SAM stands in the passageway where JILL's lorry was first
    parked. The only hint of its once-upon-a-time presence is
    a small splodge of oil by the kerb. SAM stands lost and
    beaten under a street light. He slumps down to the
    pavement unsure his next move. The street light is
    reflected in the pool of oil. As he stares at the
    reflected light it expands and becomes a patch of blue
    cloud-filled sky. SAM turns to look at the actual street
    light. It has become a crack of blazing light coming thru
    the inner wall of the great stone ship.
<b>

</b>               I'm here Sam. Don't give up.
<b>    
</b>    SAM is pushing thru the GREY PRISONERS. The light from the
    crack shafts across the space in which they find
    themselves imprisoned, striking the opposite wall. There
    in the bright pool of light are SAM's wings - beautiful,
    shimmering silver... But, nailed to a large stone
    cruciform - like a crucified eagle. SAM rushes towards
    them and begins to pull them loose, But before he can, a
    great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a
    black shadow falls across SAM and the wings. Looking round
    he saees the inner wall has split open to the level of the
    floor - but, blocking the opening is the GIANT SAMURAI
    WARRIOR. SAM draws his sword and rushes toward the GIANT.
    The GIANT stands ominously still. Then very slowly he
    raises his spear in front of himself in an almost
    religious gesture. Poof! He vanishes! SAM is confused.
    Suddenly a PRISONER shouts a warning and SAM spins round
    just in time to avoid a slash of the spear by the gigantic
    WARRIOR who is now standing directly behind him. SAM
    parries a couple more thrusts of the spear and then
    strikes with his sword. At thin air! The GIANT has
    vanished again. SAM can't figure it out. But he hears
    something whoosh and instinctively dodges as the GIANT who
    is once again behind him brings the spear crashing down.
    Again SAM manages a few parries as he is forced backwards.
    He trips and falls to the ground. The spear goes into the
    ground.
<b>    
</b>    Before the GIANT can wrench the spear loose, SAM slashes
    at him with his sword. But again the GIANT disappears. SAM
    spins around. The GIANT is a short distance from him. SAM
    rushes him. Again he vanishes. This time he reappears next
    to the spear and tries to free it. But SAM attacks again
    and the GIANT is forced to do his vanishing act before he
    can recover the spear. SAM is becoming exasperated with
    his behaviour, and as the GIANT reappears he shouts at him
    to hold still, at the same time throwing his sword at the
    big fellow. The sword pins the GIANT's foot to the ground
    before he can disappear. Instead of blood pouring from the
    wound, fire issues forth. SAM takes advantage of the
    situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground.
    The GIANT is unable to escape as SAM charges, but manages
    to dodge a bit. However the spear catches his arm and
    opens a gash. Again fire pours out. As the big GUY tries
    to stop the fire, SAM charges again. This time he succeeds
    in striking dead centre. The GIANT gasps as fire gushes
    from his chest. He staggers and crashes to the ground. The
    wounds continue to bleed fire.
<b>    
</b>    SAM gets his breath back and approaches the fallen
    WARRIOR. Reaching down he removed the GIANT's mask. Fire
    rushes forth from all the facial orifices. But the thing
    that makes him catch his breath is the face itself. It's
    his ... SAM's! While he stares in amazement the fire
    begins to melt the face. In a moment it is unrecognizable.
    SAM stands there stunned. Somewhere in the distance a bell
    tolls.
<b>    
</b><b>    
</b><b>118 EXT.   JUST AROUND THE CORNER            NIGHT         118
</b><b>    
</b>    SAM's face is reflected in the puddle of oil. He is
    staring wide-eyed. A church bell tolls in the distance.
    SAM is definitely spooked. He scrambles to his feet. He's
    got to get out of here. He heads off down the passageway
    but is brought quickly to a halt. There, in the shadows,
    is SOMEONE smoking a cigarette. He hesitates and reverses
    direction but, before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice
    comes from behind him.
<b>    
</b><b>                             JILL

    cigarette in her mouth.

    into a kiss to explain their presence. The car hesitates
    for a moment and drives on.

    its disgusting steel and rubber entrails, filling most of
    the available space and making progress through the flat
    difficult. Half a dozen MEN are at work. They are
    impossible to identify because they wear arctic clothing

</b>    SAM creeps along the corridor to the lift door - avoiding
    a GROUP OF SECURITY MEN who are singing carols in close
    harmony. ONE GUARD is conducting and giving instruction.
    They are all incredibly big and brutal looking.

</b>    The office is empty. SAM looks around - not sure what he
    wants to do. He notices his MOTHER's picture on HELPMANN's
    desk. He is just about to leave when his eye is caught by
    an elaborate computer console in a side room. It
    occasionally chatters away. Paper print-outs fill a large
    bin. Hesitantly SAM approaches it. Looking around to make
    sure the room is still empty he punches the On key and the
    machine lights up.
<b>    
</b>    He cautiously pushes a couple more keys. The teleprinter
    machines have paused but one starts chattering now. He
    looks at the one which is busy. A CLOSE UP shows us the

<b>    REQUEST FEEDBACK STATUS ON SUBJECT BENJAMIN GEORGE
</b><b>    TROLLOPE - VAGRANT - DETAINED TERRORIST/SUSPECT/ASSOCIATE.
</b>    This is followed by a code number. The teleprinter falls
    silent.
<b>    
</b>    SAM returns to the keyboard and switches it off. He turns
    to leave.
    The teleprinter starts chattering again. SAM stops and
    goes back to it and looks at the page again. A CLOSE UP
    shows us: UPDATE - SUBJECT TROLLOPE DECEASED - CAUSE OF
<b>    DEATH GUNSHOT RESISTING ARREST. PLEASE DELETE FROM SPECIAL
</b>    CATEGORY. The computer spool revolves back and forth for
    two or three seconds and then stops. SAM ponders this for

    on the machine. He has he answer.

    from the extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly. She
    looks like the DREAM GIRL. SAM stands open-mouthed. JILL

    about a beautiful blue sky. They course this way and that.
    Pulling back we reveal that this patch of sky is inside a
    mammoth glass-like cube held aloft by four stone columns.
    The absolutely amazing scale of this cube is revealed as
    SAM sweeps up into shot - his wings gleaming in the light.
    He is a tiny speck but, overjoyed -he has found the day.
    far below him the GREY PRISONERS gather beaming with
    happiness. Diving back to the ground - SAM unsheaths his
    sword and holding it aloft rushes to the base of one of
    the great columns. The FORCES OF DARKNESS who have been
    lurking in the shadows slink back. SAM, with one mighty
    swing, strikes the column - the noise reverberates as
    cracks begin to race up and through the column. It is
    disintegrating. As it crumbles the mammoth cube begins to
    topple. Everyone steps back. Down it plummets. And smashes
    into a million pieces. The bright blue sky escapes in all
    directions. The GREY PRISONERS' iron collars and chains
    fall from their necks as they stand, surrounded by a
    beautiful blue sky. They look up to the sun. SAM is
    exultant.

               All this is going to take time and
               money, and I'm afraid, according to
               your bank statement and credit rating
               here, you're likely to be in deep
               financial trouble by the end of it.
               Now, either you plead guilty to say,
               seven or eight of these charges,
               which'll bring the costs down to
               within your reach, or you can borrow
               a sum to be negotiated, from us, at
               very competitive rates. We can offer
               you something at say, eleven and a
               half per cent, over thirty years. But
               you will have to buy insurance to
               qualify for his scheme.

               Now, since you've elected to plead
               not guilty on all these charges,
               you'd be well advised to take some
               sort of insurance cover. Preferably
               comprehensive, or if you'd prefer,
               something more specific - say,
               against electrical charges over
               f70.00. And for food and
               accommodation costs of say, £800.00.

</b>    The flap is closed and opened again very quickly - NEW
    OFFICIALS are revealed. This process repeats again and

    seem to become a changing blur. Their voices overlap in a
    growing cacophony. The desk and the other items in the
    room remain static. To add to this disturbing effect the
    FORCES OF DARKNESS begin to gather in the room behind the
    OFFICIALS. As they increase in number they begin to press
    forward unseen by the OFFICIALS. Soon they fill the view

</b><b>    
</b>    The bag comes off. SAM finds himself strapped into an
    Information Retrieval chair. The CAMERA tracks back
    frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an
    unbelievably vast room. The walls curve up and out of
    sight.
<b>    
</b>    The floor doesn't seem to be a floor at all - strange
    light undulates beneath. The whole effect is one of total
    disorientation and overwhelming size. SAM is desperately
    trying to take it in. Next to the chair is a porcelain
    tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments.
    Worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at
    hand. As the GUARDS leave SAM to take up their positions
    near the distant door they hand over documents to the
    white-coated INFORMATION RETRIEVAL OFFICER.

</b>    They all sign the document which the I.R. OFFICER retains
    after giving carbon copies to the GUARDS. The GUARDS then
    proceed to the door and take up positions on either side
    of it. The I.R. OFFICER heads toward SAM. We can now see
    he wears a mask. It is the face of the FORCES OF DARKNESS.
    A smiling baby doll face. SAM sits, mesmerized, watching
    him approach. Within fifteen or twenty yards of SAM the
    I.R. OFFICER comes to an abrupt halt. He seems to sway.
    After a moment he turns slightly, hesitantly, giving the
    impression that he may return to the door. He looks at the
    GUARDS, pauses, straightens himself up, takes a deep
    breath and continues again towards SAM, rather more
    briskly than before. SAM watches, terrified and
    fascinated. The I.R. OFFICER goes to the table which is
    covered with evil-looking surgical-type instruments - he
    blunders clumsily into it, knocking a couple of them onto
    the floor. He picks then up quickly and replaces them.

</b>    The I.R. OFFICER reacts to this as if he's been hit in the
    solar plexus, and he tries to disguise it by simulating a
    coughing fit. He then picks up a nasty looking implement
    and advances on SAM.

    leaps through the hole.

               to get clear!
<b>    
</b>    TUTTLE tosses SAM a dark overcoat to cover his light grey
    detainee outfit. Together, the TWO GROUPS burst out
    through the door into the large empty forecourt.
<b>    
</b><b>    
</b><b>137 EXT.   FORECOURT                         NIGHT          137
</b><b>    
</b>    The forecourt is suddenly illuminated by huge arc lights.
    Machine gun installations open fire. The RESCUERS are
    totally exposed.
<b>    
</b>    They are cut down left and right.
    Desperately they battle their way across the open space.
    Time running out. SAM, knowing the way, leads TUTTLE
    towards a shielded spot. Will they make it? As the last
    RESCUER is cut down SAM and TUTTLE dive for cover.
    KOWBLAMMPOW! A massive explosion. Then another. And
    another. SECURITY TROOPS caught unprotected are decimated.
    SAM looks up. Christ! The building is being blown to bits.
    Certain windows are lit. They spell out MERRY XMAS. With a
    final massive haemorrhage the building erupts in a geyser
    of masonry, steel, paper and dozens of T.V. consoles and
    visual aid apparatus including, in large chunks, MR
    HELPMANN's masterpiece. But also tons and tons of paper.
<b>    
</b>    Every file in the building has burst its seams and ejected
    its load skywards. The night sky is full of white
    rectangular wisps. Ashlike they flutter down over the
    city. SAM looks around and can't see TUTTLE anywhere. He
    shouts for him. But the remaining TROOPS have spotted SAM
    and SAM runs.
<b>    
</b><b>    
</b><b>138 EXT.   CITY PASSAGES                     NIGHT         138

</b><b>139 EXT.   SHOPPING                          PRECINCT     NIGHT139
</b><b>    
</b>    Eluding his pursuers, SAM dives into a crowded, garishly
    lit, shopping centre. Once among the protective company of
    he mindlessly shopping MOB, SAM slows down and proceeds
    casually. The SHOPPERS go about their programmed business
    paying no attention to the paperwork swirling about them.
    Searching the CROWD, SAM spots TUTTLE making his way
    towards him. TUTTLE is having a bit of trouble walking
    against the steadily increasing wind. As he proceeds
    across an open area a blown piece of paper. catches on his
    foot. He tries shaking it off.
<b>    
</b>    It remains firmly stuck. While he is struggling with the
    piece of paper another, larger piece catches his other
    leg. He begins to lose his temper trying to dislodge the
    flying debris. Another hits him and twists around his arm.
    Still more paper blows against him. He is having
    difficulty staying upright. Twisting this way and that he
    tries to free himself, but more and more paper covers him.
    He is practically obscured from view. SAM can't believe
    what he is seeing. SHOPPERS continue about their business,
    apparently unaware of TUTTLE'S terrible plight. Apart from
    ONE SHOPPER who loses control of her shopping trolley -
    and watches it career down the steps of the shopping
    precinct. By now TUTTLE is totally encased in this cocoon
    of litter. He is now just a ball of paper writhing about
    on the ground. SAM has to do something. He rushes out from
    his hiding place and tries to pull the litter off TUTTLE.
    The pieces come loose with surprising ease. The wind
    carries them away as SAM frantically tears at the pile.
    But there is no sign of TUTTLE. Nothing. The last few
    pieces of paper flutter away leaving SAM standing there
    with a couple of posters in his hands. He realises that he
    is suddenly very visible. All the shopping bustle has
    stopped. They are all staring at him. SAM spots TROOPS
    shouldering their way towards him. He turns tail and
    dashes off.

</b><b>    
</b>    The drawing room door burst open as SAM dashes in. SAM
    goes straight through and into the bedroom. The room is
    empty of all terrestrial human life forms. A hollow wind
    blows the curtains.
<b>    
</b><b>    
</b><b>141 INT.   MOTHER'S BEDROOM                  NIGHT         141
</b><b>    
</b>    The room is in chaos (and there is a hole in the ceiling).
    SAM turns and sees a silhouette in the doorway. He rushes
    forwards.

</b><b>

               at the end. The doctor said there was
               no pain.
<b>

</b><b>    
</b>    SAM comes running around corner. He is suddenly bathed in
    a strange blue light. He halts and looks up. There
    opposite him is a large blue neon cross above the entrance
    to a chapel of dully modernistic design. Holy music from
    an electric organ can be heard. SAM rushes up the stops
    and through the door.
<b>    
</b><b>    
</b><b>144 INT. CHAPEL OF OUR LADY OF THE CHECK-OUT COUNTER NIGHT 144

<b>    
</b><b>                             SPIRO

<b>    
</b>    SAM, dumbfounded, follows.
<b>    
</b>    CUT to SAM being lead into the middle of the cold, modern
    chapel which, possibly for the occasion, has been tarted
    up with some red velvet curtains that help make it a bit
    theatrical. A large flower-smothered coffin rests on some
    sort of raised stand in front of the altar, a VICAR stands
    in the pulpit, and a fair sprinkling of PEOPLE sit in
    stepped seats on three sides of the room.
<b>    
</b>    The coffin is closed, but a length of bandage has escaped
    the lid. Standing amidst the floral tributes is a large,
    rather idealized, colour portrait of MRS TERRAIN looking
    not so much young as beautiful. Among the MOURNERS are DRS
    JAFFE and CHAPMAN and others in their operating gowns.
<b>    
</b><b>    
</b>    To enlarge on the scene, we see SHIRLEY T snuffling in her
    hanky and a few others chatting amongst themselves, the
    VICAR standing in his pulpit waiting to get on with it,
    etc. CUT to SAM trying to take all this in, stopping in
    the middle of the room. Don't forget DR CHAPMAN sobbing.

</b><b>    
</b>                     VICAR (in background)
               At these times of giving and
               receiving let's remember the greatest
               gift of all: not a gift to be
               spurned, not a gift to be opened and
               carelessly set on one side, not a
               gift to be taken back and changed,
               but the gift of eternal life. Mrs
               Terrain has just received that most
               wonderful of all gifts. She came to
               us physically new, she goes hence
               from us not so physically new. But
               the spirit never grows old. And in
               the domain of the Eternal Giver, Mrs

               forever.
<b>    
</b>    ..... (CUT to SAM's POV) ... past SPIRO to a section in
    the bleachers directly across from the coffin and the
    VICAR where a WOMAN (her back to SAM) is surrounded by a
    buzzing flock of very handsome and well-dressed YOUNG MEN.

</b><b>               TERRIFIC CRASH.
</b><b>    
</b>    CUT to entrance to Chapel as a squad of TROOPS come
    crashing in. PEOPLE begin to scatter, screaming. The
    TROOPS spot SAM who dashes away from his MOTHER and heads
    for a door behind the altar. In his panic he crashes
    against the coffin which topples over spilling its
    contents ... a hundredweight of offal. SAM covers his
    mouth and dashes through the door.
<b>    
</b><b>    
</b><b>145 EXT.   MAZE-LIKE DARK PASSAGES           NIGHT          145
</b><b>    
</b>    CUT to SAM, really dashing madly, tripping over things,
    hurting himself, getting up running.
    He is in a maze of machinery. Every way he turns his path
    seems blocked by either TROOPS or FIGURES from his dreams.
    The walls of the maze become more simplified as he goes
    deeper into it. More rectangular, higher. We see a top
    shot of the maze with SAM separate from the pursuing
    FORCES but they are closing in on him from all sides. The
    maze extends as far as we can see. SAM turns left and
    right through it, always there is a chance of turnings.
    Until ... he rounds a corner and for the first time there
    is nowhere to go. The maze leads straight ahead to a dead
    end.
    At the end of the maze is a great pile of detritus from
    the consumer society. Televisions, washing machines, hair
    dryers, junk. SAM can do nothing but try to dig through
    this pile.
<b>    
</b><b>    
</b>    Maybe he can defend himself with something here. He
    scrabbles away. Looking back he sees the massed AGENTS,
    TROOPS, FORCES OF DARKNESS heading toward him. No escape.
    He digs, harder, faster. Junk flies everywhere. He
    actually reaches the end wall. Back to it, he turns to
    face the foe. But as he moves against the wall his hand
    touches something. A door knob. He turns. It's a door. The
    knob turns easily. The door swings open. SAM dives through
    it.
<b>    
</b><b>    
</b><b>146 INT.   HABITATION UNIT                   NIGHT         146
</b><b>    
</b>    SAM finds himself in a strange little house empty of
    furniture except a few fitted cupboards and a fitted bed
    frame. He tries to lock the door behind him but there is
    no key. He puts his weight against the door to keep it
    shut. From outside there is the general noise of pursuit
    but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet
    uniform engine-sound. SAM lets go of the door carefully.
    He looks around but there is only one window and it is
    shuttered. He carefully opens the door a crack and he sees-
<b>    
</b>    SAM'S POV: A rapidly receding street.

</b><b>    
</b>    - The lurch throws SAM to one side. He picks himself up,
    and, fighting the centrifugal force, works his way to the
    shuttered window which is at the front end of the house,
    in the wall opposite the door. SAM undoes the shutters and
    finds himself looking at the rear window of JILL's cab. He
    sees the back of the DRIVER's head. The DRIVER is wearing
    JILL's cap. He sees the back of the DRIVER's cab. He bangs
    on the glass of the cab. The DRIVER raises her head so
    that the face is visible to SAM in the driving mirror. He
    sees that it is JILL, in a flat cap. She smiles at him.
    SAM sobs with relief and love.

</b><b>    
</b>    Half hidden in the heart of the valley is the truck with
    the house on its back. Creepers and wild roses have grown
    up over the truck and some of the house. A curl of smoke
    rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to
    one of the walls. A small piece of ground around the truck
    has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a
    vegetable plat. There is also a pretty cow, and some
    chickens. JILL appears locking like CRUSOE carrying a
    basket of eggs.
