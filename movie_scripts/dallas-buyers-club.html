</b>
    Ambient sounds of the CROWD, RODEO, SEX, and a strange
    RINGING fade in along with IMAGES of...

    A COWBOY riding a BULL in an enclosed RODEO ring.

    RON WOODROOF, early 40's, handsome, long sandy hair, denim
    clad, worn snakeskin boots, dusty, cowboy hat, mirrored
    aviators, is engaged in wild SEX with a WOMAN. He watches the
    rodeo through open slats in a BULL STALL as the STEER throws
    the COWBOY violently thru the air; he lands hard on the dirt.
    Another WOMAN snorts cocaine and offers some to Ron as he
    switches over to having SEX with her.

    The BULL STOMPS the Cowboy with its HOOFS.

    Ron climaxes -- pleasure and pain seem to come out of him, but
    we can't hear him, only this strange RINGING.

    RODEO CLOWNS grab the Cowboy's limp body and drag him out of
    the ring.

    Ron catches his breath; something is off.

    A Dallas NEWSPAPER folded in half. July. 1985.      AIDS. New
    treatment. In Paris. ROCK HUDSON on the cover.      A HAND
    scribbles numbers over the photo.

</b>                Where'd ya hear that?

    CLINT (32) a greasy hick who's spent the last five months
    under the hood of a CHEVY, hands RON a WAD of CASH.

<b>                          RON
</b>                It's called a newspaper.     You heard of
                it?

    Ron smiles, adjusts his cowboy hat as he records some bets.
    Nearby, BULL FIGHTERS are putting on their clown makeup.

<b>                          RON
</b>                What a waste. All that fine Hollywood

    A HAND comes down through the slats holding a ten dollar bill.

    ROG slides another ten down; Ron snatches it.

</b>                Who the hell's Rock Hudson?

    Ron looks at Rog.   A beat, then he starts laughing, then
    coughing...


<b>3   EXT. RODEO STADIUM - BULL STALL - DAY                            3
</b>
    ...and coughing as we follow him into the stalls. Ron glad-
    hands as he goes; it seems everyone knows him but doesn't
    necessarily like him. He makes his way toward T.J., white
    trash, pale as winter, who wipes vomit from his chin. As he
    nervously looks down at the big angry BULL he's about to ride,
    Ron hands him a pint of tequila.

<b>                          RON
</b>                Calm the nerves, brother.     You look
                great.

    T.J. takes a swig, gives him a look.

<b>                          RON
</b>                It's your day, I can feel it.

    T.J. watches as Ron takes a bottle of NYQUIL out of his pocket
    and downs it... to stop his hacking cough.

<b>                          T.J.
</b>                I don't know, Ron.

    Ron fans the money out for T.J. to see.

                by a hundred dollar hooker before you can
                scrape the bullshit off your boots.

    Ron winks and smiles. T.J. signals the BULLMAN that he's
    ready. And in five, four, three, two, one...

    THE GATE is up, the BULL is out, the crowd is HOLLERING and
    T.J.'s back is bending in unnatural ways.

<b>                          RON
</b>                Ah hen shit!

    Ron looks to the BLEACHERS.   The GAMBLERS are already
    searching for him.

    Ron slips out a SIDE ENTRANCE.


<b>4   EXT. RODEO STADIUM - PARKING LOT - DAY                           4
</b>
    Sweating, heart racing, Ron runs across the lot and jumps over
    fences to escape THE GAMBLERS that are running after him. As
    they close in, Ron spots a cop, TUCKER, walking towards his
    patrol car.

<b>                          RON
</b>                Hey, buddy I need you to arrest me.

    Tuck sees the angry mob approaching.

<b>                          TUCKER
</b>                Figure it out yourself.

    And with that, Ron PUNCHES Tucker in the face.    The mob of
    Gamblers are stopped in their tracks.

<b>                          TUCKER
</b>                You son of a bitch!

    Tucker PUNCHES Ron in the face twice, then cuffs him.    He
    looks at the mob of Gamblers.

<b>                          TUCKER
</b>                Get the fuck outta here before I arrest
                all of you.

    Ron smiles through a bloodied mouth.

                Though I can't imagine how disappointed
                he must be havin' you for a son.

    Tucker looks at him, half-smiles.

</b>                Get the fuck outta my car.

    Ron smiles, starts to get out, then stops. Holds his head a
    moment. We hear the strange RINGING sound again.

    Ron forces a smile, then exits the car. Tucker watches as Ron
    slowly heads toward his trailer; something seems off. After a
    few beats, Tucker brushes it off and pulls away.

</b>
    Books, newspapers, empty beer cans and liquor bottles; on
    the wall, we may notice a painting of some Texas Wildflowers.
    Ron stumbles in as the RINGING sound comes back. He stops,
    steadies himself on a piece of furniture, takes a few steps
    then collapses, unconscious.


<b>8   INT. RON'S TRAILER - MORNING                                     8

    The first shafts of sunlight fall over Ron, still asleep where
    he dropped. After a few beats, he stirs, pulls himself on to
    a chair. "What the fuck?".

    Lunch time. Already a little drunk, Ron finishes off a pint
    of whiskey as Clint and a battered T.J. eat sandwiches nearby.
    Ron starts coughing again as he grabs a packet of cocaine out
    of his shirt pocket. He slides it across the table to Clint
    who hands him cash.

     A MEXICAN WORKER has his leg caught in the drill. It's
     severed and he's losing blood fast. Ron walks over.

     Ron takes his OWN shirt off, rips it in half, kneels down next
     to the MEXICAN, wipes some sweat off his brow and ties a
     makeshift tourniquet around his leg.

     Ron looks to the Foremen.

     He walks off to call.    Ron turns back to the Mexican.

     The guy nods. Ron walks over to the electrician's box. He's
     a little DRUNK. He grabs a wire and is about to cut it.

<b>                           RON (CONT'D)

     Ron cuts the wire, an electrical spark shoots out and before
     he can move back the box blows up in his face. Everything
     goes black.

     Ron, head and eyes bandaged, lays on a bed. After a few
     beats, he peels off the eye bandages, gets up. He opens a
     cabinet, then a drawer. Finds a bag of sucking CANDY, pops a
     piece in his mouth, puts some in his pocket. He sees his
     jacket on the back of the door, searches his pockets for a
     cigarette. He's about to light one when Dr. Sevard enters
     with Eve Sakes. Both wear surgical masks and latex gloves.

     That is Ron's POV as he listens to Ferris, looking around at
     the crowd, who are almost exclusively gay MEN. Ron wanders
     toward a table lined with LITERATURE. An EFFEMINATE MAN
     approaches him with a pamphlet. Ron stares at him blankly.
     The man opens his arms to give him a hug.

     drifts toward the front, where the CROWD is getting hostile.

     Ron downs a shooter and grimaces again. He slams the glass
     down on a table among empty glasses and looks up at the
     candles on a stage in front of a STRIPPER, lost in his
     thoughts. Then he looks up and sees something across the
     room, past the stripper. She tries to get his attention.

                 effective in stopping the progression of
                 AIDS in asymptomatic cases. Dr. Anthony
                 Fauci, head of the National Institute of
                 Health, announced that a trial had
                 clearly shown that early AZT intervention
                 will keep AIDS at bay. AZT is the only
                 drug that has been shown in
                 scientifically controlled trials to be
                 safe and effective, Fauci contended.

                  the right to be mentally healthy or

                  medical care that is approved by the Food

                  direct interference with a drug whose own
                  agency has found to be non-toxic. The

                  prevent them from getting help.

</b>                  The law does not seem to make much common

                  terminally ill they ought to be able to
                  take just about any drug they feel will
                  help... but that is not the law. Mr.
                  Woodroof, there is not a person in this
                  courtroom who is not moved to compassion
                  by your plight, what is lacking here is
                  the legal authority to intervene. I'm

      his legs over the railing, straddles the stall, stays above
