          The kids fighting have jeans that are falling off and one of
          them has lost a gym shoe.
                         
          In the windows everyone cheers them on, pounding the
          Plexiglas. Including Jolie and Christine.
                         
          Above them in the windows are two televisions of the fight,
          that face the street. In the TV, the boxers and the referee
          shuffle aimlessly around the ring.
                         
          The kids on the sidewalk are scrappy; they grab and stretch
          at shirts; neither can escape the others' grasp.
                         
          They reach a stalemate, knotted awkwardly and exhausted; fury
          replaced by heavy breathing; one has a bloody nose and a huge

          On television Golota throws a combo of blows below the belt
          and Bowe tumbles to the mat. The referee jumps and waves
          furiously at the penalty which he reports to the judges in a
          series of arm waves and animated hand signals.
                         
          We see the people in the front rows at the boxing match,
          almost all white, and wearing glamorous suits and dresses.
