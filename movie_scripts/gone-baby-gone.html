          Morning.

          Clouds moving through the sky.

          We see various shots of the city, exterior storefronts,
          people going about their lives and some wider shots of the
          city.

          As they continue, the hour gets progressively later in the
          day until the final sequence which takes place at night.
          Over this we hear our guy, PATRICK (30).

</b>                     To people who grow up here, this city is
                     like family. The thing about family,
                     about the city, about the church, about
                     the people you grow up with-- is that no
                     matter how much they hurt you, no matter
                     what the cost is, you still love them.

                     And despite all our flaws-- what we do to
                     each other-- what is done to us-- I've
                     always felt proprietary about it all.

                     Like the old commercial for dog food:
                     'doesn't your dog deserve to be treated
                     like a member of the family?' I've always
                     believed it depended on the dog. Beyond
                     that, the most I thought about anything
                     was what I wanted to do. Who I wanted to
                     be. To rise where my father said I
                     couldn't go, to succeed. To be a man.

          A playground at night, completely empty. One of the swings
          drifts back and forth . . .
          The back door to a home is open. A piece of light cuts across
          the porch from inside . . .

                         
          Up the back stairwell another door is open, leading into an

          Down the hall, a third door opens to reveal a small, sparse
          bedroom. A small mattress on the floor holds a dirty-faced
          little girl asleep under her blanket . . .
          Footsteps heard, quietly moving through the house . . .
          A three foot gate hangs open. A car starts and pulls away.
           We begin to hear the voice of Jack Doyle.

          TV: A clip from an interview with Amanda's mother, HELENE
          MCCREADY (29-39). She looks haggard and in desperate need of
          sleep, if not a stint in detox. Standing beside her is her
          brother LIONEL and sister-in-law BEATRICE, both of whom we
          will come to know later.

                    The whole force is outside the house.

                         
          They are parked on a street in Dorchester lined with
          residential apartments and storefronts.

                         
          A KNOCK on the windowsill startles them both. It's A

          Over Patrick and through the windshield we see A MAN AND A
          WOMAN emerge from a MINT GREEN 3-DECKER.

          They kiss before parting ways. The MAN hops into a GREEN
          LINCOLN while the WOMAN heads down the block, on foot.

          Angie jumps out and starts following the woman. Patrick pulls
          slowly from the curb and trails the Lincoln.

          He sees an ITALIAN MAN IN HIS SIXTIES looking at him from the

          While you wouldn't think there were many clamoring to get
          into their club, they don't look kindly on potential

          At one end of the bar, LENNY (mid 40' s) sips a whiskey and
          studies the Keno results. In the rear, 4 ALCOHOLICS sit
          around muttering to one another. And at one of the tables a
          CAULIFLOWER FACED MAN drinks alone.
          In addition there is a SMATTERING OF ROUGH LOOKING FACES.
          The bartender BIG DAVE (hence the name) has a newspaper
          spread out before him on the bar.

                    thousand kids get abused every year.
                    There are half a million convicted,
                    registered sex offenders, two-thirds of

                    There's a group, the 'Rene Guyon'
                    society, whose motto is 'sex before eight
                    or it's too late.' There's a rise in the
                    victimization of 'pre-verbal' children,
                    for the obvious reason that they can't
                    report their accusers. One in five
                    American girls is sexually abused or
                    victimized before they turn eighteen. But
                    only one third of those every tells

          From the sky, lit by the last slivers of light from a setting
          sun, we see the Quincy quarry. It has become, in essence, a
          huge lake, set a hundred or so feet into a rock quarry and
          surrounded by acres of dense pine. As we travel past the
          quarry, we see PATRICK'S CAR IN A PARKING LOT.

          Poole cocks the shotgun. Bressant picks up the radio in his
          car.

          Bressant throws the radio on his seat and starts for the
          house. As he goes, he turns back to Patrick.

          As they reach the sidewalk out front, Bressant cuts across
          the yard toward the side of the house. Poole heads for the
          front door.
          Bressant does a ONE ARM COCK of the shotgun before
          disappearing from Patrick's sight.

          SHOTS FIRE THROUGH THE DOOR and clip into Poole. It seems
          almost too clumsy to be real. He falls over, holding his
          neck.
          A moment of STUNNED SILENCE, then:
          Patrick runs from the car. Staying low, he races for the
          cover of the FRONT YARD OF THE HOUSE.

          grass, looks over his shoulder.

                         
          Patrick reaches Poole and lies on top of him. He messily
          checks for a pulse, gets smeared with blood.
          Poole is torn up. Several rounds hit where the vest wasn't,
          including his neck. He grunts. Patrick fumbles for his cell
          phone.

          Patrick hears shots from inside. He leaves his phone by Poole
          and heads inside.
          HOWLING can be heard from within.

<b>          INT TRETT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>          The foyer floor is spattered with blood. He cautiously moves
          forward.
          Into a completely bare room. He moves to the hallway.
          Just inside the hall a BODY lies motionless on its stomach.
          Patrick inches through the door, crouches next to the body,
          and cranes his head. It's Leon Trett: DEAD.
          Patrick momentarily pauses to examine Leon.

<b>                         BOOM
</b>           A GUNSHOT explodes and a SLUG rips into the wall above
          Patrick's head, showering him in plaster.
          Looking up, he sees Roberta Trett at the far end of the hall
          gripping her revolver.

                         
          BOOM BOOM, two more shots bury into the wall.

          She CHARGES. Patrick whips open a door opposite the one he
          just came through and leaps out of the hallway . . .
          And TRIPS up a staircase        SMACKING HIS FACE against the

          Roberta FIRES UP AT HIM. He scrambles up the stairs and
          crashes his body against a STEEL DOOR at the top. It flies
          open and he tumbles through.

          Patrick spins over and kicks the door closed. He springs to
          his feet, throws his body against the door, and locks it with
          the heavy DEAD BOLT on the POLICE DOOR.
          WHAM. Roberta slams into the other side of the door with
          everything she's got. She does it again, WHAM. And again,
          WHAM. But the door holds. Patrick turns to survey his
          surroundings.
          Patrick moves to ANOTHER ROOM outfitted with a COFFEE TABLE
          piled high with empty beer cans, a frayed COUCH, a small TV.
          The room connects to a small BEDROOM. Patrick steps toward.
          A SOILED, BARE MATTRESS lies in one corner.

                         
          Patrick steps in, his gun raised . . .

                         
          And finds himself staring directly into the face of:

<b>          CORWIN EARLE.

          a half-shirt. His stare is bug-eyed &amp; frightened.
          Corwin stares at Patrick, scared.

          He looks up at Patrick like a whipped dog, eyes shifting
          nervously to the door.

                         
          Patrick cautiously pushes open the door to the bathroom.
          He looks in the sink. There are bloody children's underwear
          soaking.
          Then Patrick looks in the BATHTUB.

</b>          And sees, curled in the fetal position, SAMUEL PIETRO,
          gagged, bound and suffocated. His bluish face frozen in a
          scream.

<b>          BLACK.
</b>          The blood rushes from Patrick's head. He retches violently.

          takes longer and requires more strength than he thought it
          would to fire.

          In the reflection, we see Angle come up behind Patrick and

                    Back in '95 we were paying a hundred an

          Patrick leaps out of his chair and drives his head into

          TRAIL OF BLOOD runs away from it which Patrick follows across
          the street.
          The thickening trail leads Patrick along the side of a LARGE
          3-STORY FACTORY (in the process of being converted to lofts)
          and to a DOOR near the back. Blood is smeared on the door and

          He climbs one flight.
          And then another -- pausing on the landing. Above him, light
          comes through an OPEN DOOR. He starts for it.
          Patrick continues up the last few steps. He reaches the top
          and peers out onto:

          another corner to see:

                         
          Bressant sits against an aluminum vent - - his head leaned
          back and his eyes half closed. A ROSE OF BLOOD spreads out
          against Bressant's shirt. His flesh is beginning to grey.

</b>          I trust the Police when they tell me
          something. And I had a fake ransom note
          and Amanda's blanket the cops left in my
          mailbox. And I heard the tape from when
          Cheese, or I guess it was Chris
          pretending to be Cheese, called the
          station.

</b>          The car speeds along the empty highway, carving through thick
          forests of pine trees.
          Inside the car it's quiet. Patrick's stare is fixed to the
          road -- the rhythm of the white lines that pulse by. Angie
          rests her head against the passenger window, the BLUR of the
          tree-line reflected in her eyes.

          a hundred yards or so off the road. But after only a few

          Suburban. He dips down, allowing Amanda to place her back-

          stuff Francine had packed to make sure Amanda would have,
          whereever she'd go.

          local cops' who are embarrassed to arrest him. He makes it
          easy for them.

          Watching from afar as Bressant is buried. In contrast to
          Mount Auburn' this is a pitiful little place. His WIFE (the

</b>          Patrick sits next to Amanda on the couch . . . And together --
          silently -- they watch TV.
           Patrick sees that Amanda is holding her famous doll, the one

</b>                     I started going to Church again. I saw
                     them bury Remy and, for the first time in
                     years, maybe ever, I prayed for someone.
                     I did everything I wanted to do. I proved
                     my father wrong. I either learned my
                     lesson or became a man, I can't tell the
                     difference . Either way, all it' s left me
                     is the hollow, copper aftertaste in my
                     throat, like a vague and distant regret.
                     Remy was right, I know very little--but
                     what I do know, I am sure of: I was wrong
                     about that commercial. "Shouldn' t your
                     dog be treated like a member of the
                     family?" It doesn't depend on the dog. It
                     depends on the family.
          We hold on them for an extended beat. The blather from the
          television washes over them, the man and the little girl.
