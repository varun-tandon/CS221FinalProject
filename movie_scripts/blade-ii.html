<b>            EXT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - NIGHT
</b>
            PULL BACK from a neon red cross ablaze in the cold December
            night to REVEAL an inner-city, store-front clinic.  Trash and
            leaves blow over wet, snowy pavement.

            ANGLE ON a PALE FIGURE standing across the street.  He looks
            feverish and strung-out, in serious need of a fix.  This is
            JARED NOMAK, 20s.  He starts towards the clinic.

<b>            INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</b>
            Potential DONORS sit in a waiting area, filling out forms,
            leafing through informational material.  A sign in the window
            reads: "Se habla Espanol".  Others read: "YOU ARE MAKING A
            DIFFERENCE", "GIVE LIFE", and "BECOME A PLATELET DONOR".  We
            overhear a bored-looking EMPLOYEE behind the information desk
            quizzing someone over the phone:

<b>                                EMPLOYEE
</b>                      Have you recently visited a tropical
                      country?  Uh-huh?  In the past twelve
                      months have you gotten a tattoo, non
                      sterile acupuncture, or undergone any
                      ear, skin or body piercing?

            We MOVE PAST the employee to Nomak, waiting.

<b>                                NURSE (O.S.)
</b>                      Jared Nomak?

            Nomak looks up.  We get a better look at his face now - he
            has a thin scar running from his lower lip down his chin.  A
            childhood accident, perhaps.  A NURSE smiles and motions for
            him to join her.  She's carrying a clipboard.

<b>                                NURSE (CONT'D)
</b>                      Hi.  We're ready for you now.

<b>            INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
            Nomak follows the Nurse into a dimly-lit hallway.  We track
            their progress in a convex safety mirror suspended from the
            hallway ceiling as they pass all manner of medical supplies --
            centrifuges, an apheresis device, etc.

<b>                                NURSE
</b>                          (referring to her clipboard)
                      I see from your questionnaire that you
                      don't have any immediate next of kin?

<b>                                NOMAK
</b>                      Not that I'm in contact with.

<b>                                NURSE
</b>                      Nobody to call in case of an emergency?

<b>                                NOMAK
</b>                      No --
                          (apprehensive)
                      Does that mean I can't be a donor?

<b>                                NURSE
</b>                      It depends.  We came up with some
                      unusual results on your blood test.

            Nomak follows the Nurse to a steel door were TWO SECURITY
            GUARDS await them.  Both look bored, paying little attention
            to the monitor which offers a view of the examining room
            beyond.  There is also a small window with safety glass.
            GUARD #1 opens the door, following Nomak and the Nurse
            inside.  GUARD #2 remains behind, manning the hallway.

<b>            INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
            The Nurse ushers Nomak into the room, indicating he should
            sit in a kind of reclining dental chair with arm and
            headrests.  Nomak notices a security camera mounted above.

<b>                                NOMAK
</b>                          (anxious)
                      How unusual?

            Beat.  The Nurse sets aside Nomak's file, looking
            uncomfortable.

<b>                                NURSE
</b>                      Your blood has a very rare phenotype,
                      one that's quite valuable to people like
                      us.

<b>                                NOMAK
</b>                      Us?  What are you talking about?

            A kind-faced DOCTOR enters, nodding to Guard #1.

<b>                                DOCTOR
</b>                      It's a good news-bad news scenario,
                      Jared.  Good news for us, bad for you.

            The Doctor and Nurse smile, BARING FANGS.  We realize now
            that they are both vampires.  The Guard, too.  He grips Nomak
            by the throat, forcing him back into the restraint chair.  As
            the vampire Guard does so, his hand brushes against Nomak's
            jaw.  The flesh on Nomak's chin briefly separates along the
            scar - almost as if it were a seam.

            The guard pauses - and Nomak LAUGHS.  Definitely NOT the
            reaction the vampires were expecting from a potential victim.
            Nomak starts to shake and twitch, like he's going into some
            kind of seizure.  The whites of his eyes bleed red.  He
            throws his head back, opening his mouth as a PAIR OF RAZOR
            SHARP CANINES extrude from his gums.  These are longer, much
            more lethal-looking than the fangs of the vampires and --

            Nomak lashes out, knocking the Guard backwards.  The Nurse
            SCREAMS.  Nomak clamps his mouth onto her throat, SLAMMING
            her back against the wall.

            The vampire Doctor rushes to the door, scrambling to unbolt
            it.  Nomak reaches for him, HOWLING with blood-drunk laughter
            as he lifts the Doctor up.  Nomak flings the Doctor about
            like a toy, using his body to SMASH the lights, then the
            security camera above.

<b>            INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
            We hear SCREAMS and HORRIBLE NOISES coming from the examining
            room.  Guard #2 draws a gun and looks to the security monitor
            with alarm.  The screen goes black.  He looks to the small
            window, trying to peer into the now-darkened room beyond --

            SPLASH!  A wave of blood smears across a window.  A HAND
            wipes a patch of blood away, revealing Nomak's baleful,
            distorted eyes.  Guard #2 starts to back away when --

            BANG!  Nomak slams against the other side of the steel door.
            BANG!BANG!BANG!  The door begins to bend, hand-shaped
            impressions bulging outward as Nomak starts to peel the door
            apart like it was an aluminum can.

            Guard #2 has seen enough.  He turns and runs even as the door
            CAVES INWARD off its hinges.  Forward momentum sends the door
            sliding across the hallway floor where it trips up the Guard.

<b>            ON THE DOORWAY
</b>
            as Nomak steps into the hallway.  Because of the lights
            above, there are alternating pools of light and shadow in the
            hall.  Nomak advances towards us, his face coming in and out
            of darkness.

<b>                                NOMAK
</b>                      Vampires --

            With each pool of light, his awful smile seems to distort
            further and further, until his mouth seems to be widening all
            the way back to his ears.

<b>                                NOMAK (CONT'D)
</b>                      I fucking hate vampires.

            On the floor, the vampire Guard CRIES OUT in fear, helplessly
            raising his hands to defend himself.  Nomak HOWLS and leaps
            towards him/us, blacking out the screen with his hurtling
            form as we --

<b>                                                                 CUT TO:
</b>
<b>            EXT. INNER-CITY BACK-ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
            BOOM!  A second-story door flies open and FIVE VAMPIRE thug
            wannabes come spilling out.  They race down a flight of
            stairs, tripping and tumbling over themselves.  In descending
            order, they are: RUSH, a pimped-out Vanilla Ice clone wearing
            Karl Kani gear, followed by JIGSAW, ST. CLOUD, T-BAG and
<b>            SEGURA.
</b>
<b>            BLADE
</b>
            exits just behind them, eschewing the stairs completely and
            vaulting over the railing.  He unholsters his MACH pistol as
            he drops, FIRING it as he lands in a cat-like stance on the
            snowy ground below --

            BA-BANG!  A silver-tipped bullet punches through T-Bag's
            chest.  He turns to ash even as his fellow vamps dash through
            the disintegrating cloud that used to be his body.  The
            embers melt the snow where they land.

            A super-charged foot chase ensues, with hunter and prey
            moving at speeds in excess of anything a human would ever be
            capable of.  We're talking thirty-five, even forty miles an
            hour.

<b>            ON BLADE
</b>
            Running like a bull, condensed vapor streaming from his mouth
            and nostrils.  Splashing through puddles of icy water
            storming through barriers of plywood and razor wire, leaping
            over mountains of garbage bags.

<b>            ON THE VAMPIRES
</b>
            as they flatten a length of cyclone fencing like it was crepe
            paper.  They scramble up an obstacle of waste bins, leaping
            into the air --

<b>            BACK TO BLADE
</b>
            pulling out his twin-bladed boomerang as he runs.  He flings
            the weapon.  It twirls around, catching --

<b>            ST. CLOUD IN MID-LEAP
</b>
            and cutting the vampire completely in half.  As the
            disintegrating halves of St. Cloud fall to the side, Blade
            storms over the waste bin.

<b>            EXT. INNER-CITY - SECOND ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
            The remaining vampires stumble into a narrower alley where a
            GROUP OF BUMS are warming themselves over a series of oil
            drum fires.

            Jigsaw slips, TRIPPING over one of the burning oil drums,
            catching himself ablaze.  He doesn't give a shit.  He keeps
            on running, barreling his way into --

<b>            INT. NOODLE FACTORY - NIGHT
</b>
            -- the back entrance of a cramped, sweat-shop.  Some kind of
            noodle factory filled with steam and equipment and YAMMERING
            FOREIGNERS and --

            -- here comes Blade, hot on the vampires' heels, shouldering
            workers aside and --

<b>            EXT. NOODLE FACTORY - NIGHT
</b>
            -- Rush and the remaining vamps spill out onto the street
            where a number of motorcycles are waiting for them -- two BMW
            R1200 motorbikes and a tricked-out Panhead Harley chopper
            with ape-hanger handlebars.

            Rush and Segura leap atop their BMWs.  Jigsaw rolls into a
            puddle of water, dousing himself, then jumps onto his
            chopper.  As the vamps peel out --

<b>            BLADE
</b>
            Bursts from the factory.  Segura revs his BMW, trying to run
            him down.  At the last second, Blade pivots aside like a
            matador.  Segura circles around for another try.

            Blade leaps, somersaulting through the air, then lands on the
            back of the bike behind Segura.  SHINGGG!  Blade pulls a
            retractable garrotte wire from the sleeve of his jacket and
            wraps it around Segura's throat.

            With a violent twist, Blade decapitates Segura.  As the
            vampire's headless body turns to ash before him, Blade leans
            forward and takes the controls of the speeding motorcycle.

            WHOOSH!  Blade speeds after the other vamps.

<b>            EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
            Rush and Jigsaw gun their bikes for all they're worth.  Up
            ahead, a line of construction barricades are blocking the
            way.  The vampires power on through the barricades, then
            abruptly brake --

<b>            THE OVERPASS
</b>
            before them is under construction.  There's a twenty-foot gap
            in the road where a portion is missing, pieces of re-bar
            poking out from the ends of the prefabricated sections.

            Rush and Jigsaw consider their options, but then they hear
            the ROAR of Blade's engine as he comes SCREAMING over the
            rise in the road!

            Fuck it.  Rush powers his chopper forward, making the jump,
            burning rubber as he lands on the far side.  Jigsaw torques
            his handle and follows, rocketing towards the gap.

<b>            ON BLADE
</b>
            as he snaps his hand up -- a trio of Japanese throwing stars
            appearing between his fingers like a magician's cards.  He
            flings the stars at Jigsaw's bike --

            The throwing stars hit Jigsaw's back tire and the bike goes
            down, vomiting SPARKS as it slides forward.  Jigsaw is flung
            forward like a ragdoll, out over the gap in the overpass and

            -- WHUNK!  Jigsaw is impaled on the protruding re-bar!  He
            HOWLS, instantly disintegrating as Blade makes the jump!

<b>            UP AHEAD
</b>
            Rush cuts onto an on-ramp, powering his way onto the freeway.

<b>            EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
</b>
            Hyper-speed.  Rush slouches low, trying to cut wind
            resistance and will his bike faster.  He hazards a look back.

<b>            BLADE
</b>
            is gaining on him like demon of speed.

            Rush pulls a TEC-9, FIRING back at Blade.  It's no good.
            Blade is nearly upon him, unsheathing his sword from his back
            scabbard --

            Blade JABS his sword forward into Rush's rear-wheel.  The
            bike locks up, flips over, BURSTS INTO FLAMES.  The whole
            screaming wreck slews forward, SHOWERING SPARKS --

<b>            RUSH
</b>
            goes flying onto the road, rolling over and over, one of his
            legs SNAPPING at a bone-breaking angle.  As he lies there
            MOANING, Blade circles around, sweeping past Rush's decimated
            bike, retrieving his sward from the burning wreckage.

            Blade kills the engine on his own bike and dismounts.  Rush
            is pathetically trying to drag his broken body to safety.
            Blade approaches, placing his boot heel on the back of Rush's
            neck, forcing his face against the asphalt.  He unholsters
            his MACH, pointing it at the vampire's bleeding head.
            Blade's opening line:

<b>                                BLADE
</b>                      Tell me where he his now and I'll
                      consider you a loose end.

<b>                                                                 CUT TO:
</b>
<b>            EXT. MOO-COW CREAMERY - MILK FACTORY - NIGHT
</b>
            CLOSE ON a peeling wall mural -- smiling 30s cartoon cow
            winking at us, licking her chops.  The logo reads: "TASTY".

            Blade's matte-black Charger RUMBLES into view and parks in
            front of the abandoned milk factory.  Blade steps out,
            heaving an equipment sack onto his shoulder.

<b>            INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
            THREE LACONIC VAMPIRE TOUGHS are playing poker at a card
            table, dealing out novelty nudie cards.  We hear a NOISE.
            One of the vampires approaches a reinforced door.  He slides
            open a viewing slot and peers through.  Nobody outside.  The
            vampire turns back to his poker buddies, shrugging --

</b>                      Nobody's th--

            Before the vampire can even finish his sentence, Blade's
            SWORD punches straight through the door into his chest.  He
            gasps and turns to ash as the sword disengages back out
            through the door and --

            CRASH!  The door explodes open, sending clouds of burning
            vampire embers every which way.  In walks Blade, grinning
            wickedly, MACH ready --

            As the other two vampires rise - POW!  A silver hollow-point
            hits the first one in the neck.  POW!  Another hollow-point
            takes out the second.  The vampires drop, turning to ash.

            Blade holsters his MACH, striding through vampire ash piles.
            The place is eerily quiet here, in stark contrast to the
            mayhem of the last few minutes.  Just the steady, low-pitched
            HUM of machinery.

            Blade starts forward.  Up ahead, a FAINT GLOW is emitting
            from behind an area that's been sectioned off with canvas
            tarps.  Blade sweeps one of the tarps aside --

<b>            THREE LARGE TANKS
</b>
            are hidden inside.  The first two are empty.  A MAN is
            suspended within the third, bobbing weightlessly in a sea of
            red plasma.  His long, gray hair floats about his face,
            shrouding his weathered features.  We're not sure if he's
            sleeping or dead.

                      you --

            Whistler's ace drifts around into view.  Blade shakes his
            head in sadness.  He looks about for a way to extract
            Whistler, doesn't see any obvious means, then --

            CRASH!  Blade kicks through the glass.  Blood and fluids
            flood out around him as Whistler's limp body tumbles partly
            down, but he's still suspended by the wires and medical
            leads.  Blade unsheathes his sword, severing the wires --

            Whistler falls into his arms.  Blade cradles him, then -- the
            gunsmith's eyes abruptly snap open, flooding with rage.

            Blade staggers back as the HOWLING horror that used to be his
            mentor wraps his hands around Blade's throat, forcing him to
            the ground.  Whistler ROARS, revealing a set of jagged fangs.

                      you --

            Whistler SLAMS the back of Blade's head against the concrete
            floor again and again, punctuating his words with each SLAM --

            Blade knees Whistler in the balls.  Whistler lets go, cupping
            his groin as Blade heaves him aside.
            Blade strips off his gauntlets.  Whistler springs at him
            again.  Blade sinks his fist deep in Whistler's stomach.  As
            Whistler doubles over, Blade twists Whistler's hands behind
            his back, cuffing his wrists together with a pair of titanium
            manacles.

            Blade pulls a restraint hood from his equipment bag and
            quickly slips it over Whistler's head, cinching it tight.

            Another beat.  Whistler doesn't stir.  He's down for the
            count.  Blade pauses a moment, catching his breath as he
            leans on Whistler's still form.  He's exhausted.

<b>                                BLADE

            He rises, heaving Whistler's body over his shoulder.

<b>            EXT. THE CITY - NIGHT
</b>
            Blade's battered Charger knifes through the snow-dusted urban
            blight like a shadow.  Boarded up businesses, tent cities,
            doorways bombed with graffiti throwups -- wherever this
            godforsaken Gomorrah is, it's definitely a notch down on the
            misery scale from the city Blade used to call home.

            Up ahead, the sprawl levels out, giving way to an ice-bound
            harbor wreathed in fog.

<b>            INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT
</b>
            Blade drives on, inured to the sqaulor.  He made peace with
            the darkness a long time ago.

<b>            EXT. SHIPYARD - NIGHT
</b>
            The Charger weaves its way through a maze of scrap metal and
            rusty shipping containers, homing in on a sprawling warehouse
            that's been cordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor wire.
            Utlra-violent floodlights illuminate the area, while security
            cameras keep a watchful eye.

<b>            INT. WAREHOUSE - INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
            More UV lights flicker on.  We're in a massive loading
            elevator/platform which HUMS as it ascends, eventually
            reaching its destination with a BOOMING CLANG.  The doors at
            the rear glide open.  Blade guides the Charger out.

<b>            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT
</b>
            Santa's workshop by way of Soldier of Fortune.  Industrial
            equipment is strewn everywhere.  Mills, old furnaces, gutted
            vehicles, an ad hoc surgical theater.  We also notice the big
            rig which Scud had been piloting.  Because of various leaking
            overhead pipes, the floor is slick with a sheen of water.
            Blade kills his Charger, looking around as he climbs out.

            Blade's voice ECHOES throughout the cavernous room.

            A handlebar moustached, weed-sucking stoner.  Thrift-store
            chic, wearing a Jimmy Walker "Dyn-O-Mite!" T-shirt.

</b>                      The Dark Knight returns.

            Scud is lowering himself down from the ceiling on a rope and
            pulley system where he'd been suspended in a safety harness,
            doing some kind of electrical wiring job.  He reaches the
            floor and unclips himself.  We notice he's wearing a surfer's
            charm around his neck that's been strung with vampire fangs.

            Scud pulls a half-smoked roach from behind his ear, using a
            lighter in the shape of a woman's torso to fire up.  The
            flame jets from a hole in one of her tits.  He takes a
            Spicoli-sized hit and offers the roach to Blade.

            Blade slaps it from his hand.

            Blade opens the trunk.  Scud joins him.

</b>
            is inside.  Blade unfastens the hood, slipping it off.
            Immediately, Whistler sits up, LUNGING at Blade!

<b>                                SCUD
</b>                      Fuck me!

            Blade gets Whistler in a headlock, choking him as he drags
            him out of the trunk.  It's like trying to wrestle a rabid
            pit bull.  He looks to Scud, annoyed.

<b>                                BLADE
</b>                      You going to stand there crapping your
                      pants or are you going to help me?!

            Scud steps forward, tentative.  Together, he and Blade drag
            Whistler kicking and SCREAMING across the workshop, forcing
            him into a small, cell-like room.

<b>            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - CELL - NIGHT
</b>
            WHAP!  Blade throws Whistler onto the concrete floor, pinning
            him as Scud quickly slips a series of chains around him which
            have been secured to the wall.  The opposite wall is covered
            by a series of steel shutters.  As Whistler continues to
            thrash, Blade affixes a muzzle to the older man's mouth.

<b>                                SCUD

                      in one night.

            Blade pulls out a pneumatic syringe, plunging an ampoule of
            amber-colored fluid into the bottle mount.

            Blade injects Whistler with the syringe.  Whistler HOWLS in
            pain, nearly throwing Blade and Scud off him.

                      Get back!!!

            Scud scurries away.  Whistler's struggles have taken an even
            more violent turn.  Blade beats him back down.

            Finally, Blade steps on Whistler's neck, pinning his head as
            he draws a shotgun from a holster beneath his armpit.  He
            shoves it in Whistler's SNARLING FACE.

                      morning, those shutters are going up.
                      Either you'll be cured, or you'll fry.

            Blade raises his foot from Whistler's neck, quickly backing
            out the door.  Whistler THROWS himself at Blade, nearly
            tearing the chains from the wall as --

<b>            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT
</b>
            BOOM!  Blade slams the cell door closed.  The door is heavy
            steel.  Nevertheless, Whistler kicks against it, threatening
            to tear it off its hinges.  Blade throws a heavy cross-bar
            over the door.  Then he steps back, joining Scud.

            WHUMP!WHUMP!WHUMP!  Whistler hammers the door again and again
            and again.  But the crossbar holds.  Blade glances at Scud,
            who's looking winded and shaken by the ordeal.

            Scud nods and exits.  Blade drags a chair across the floor,
            setting it in front of the door.  He sits down, shotgun
            resting across his knees, holding vigil.  And off that grim,
            stoic image we --

</b>
<b>            EXT. CITY DUMP - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)
</b>
            Daylight bleaches the image, almost whiting it out.  A WINO
            sifts through refuse, collecting bottles.  Three MUTTS are
            tethered to his side with rope.  He reaches for a bottle,
            cuts himself on a piece of glass.  As he inspects his wound,
            his dogs GROWL.  The Wino looks up --

            A BLACK KID (14) is standing atop a mountain of refuse --
            wiry and intense, perched there like a predator.  The Wino
            glances at his wrist again, the blood, then back up at the
            black kid.  Unnerved, the Wino starts to back away, then
            turns -- BUMPING right into the black kid, who has moved
            beside him with uncanny speed.  (NOTE: this all happens
            within a single, continuous shot.)

            The boy SLAMS the Wino against the trestle wall and SNARLS,
            baring FANGS.  And just as he's about to tear the man's
            throat out --

            A HAND reaches in from off-screen, pulling the boy back.
            It's WHISTLER, twenty years younger and spryer, with a head
            full of RAVEN BLACK hair.

            Whistler throws the boy into the light, forcing him onto the
            ground.  He shoves a .45 against the boy's face and is just
            about to pull the trigger when he stops, NOTICING overhead
            sun reflected in the boy's eyes.  Whistler looks up and SEES
            the sun at high noon, then glances back at the boy in
            understanding.  He smiles.

            Blade wakes up, lifts his head.  A shaft of sunlight shines
            directly down onto him, reflecting back at us from his now
            adult eyes.  Blade hasn't moved.  He sits in the chair in
            front of the cell door which is now silent.  He stands,
            unlocking the cell door.  He heaves the cross-bar away.  The
            door GROANS as he opens it.

<b>            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - CELL - DAWN
</b>
            Blade enters.  It's dark.  We can just make out Whistler's
            figure huddled in the corner like some kind of caged animal,
            his lanky, gray hair obscuring his face.

            Whistler doesn't stir.  Blade crosses over to the steel
            shutters.  For the briefest moments, he hesitates.  Then he
            hits the switch, readying his shotgun.  With a HUM, the
            shutters rise, throwing a SHAFT OF BLINDING SUNLIGHT over
            Whistler.

            Nothing happens.  Blade lowers his shotgun.  Whistler slowly
            raises his head, fixing Blade with a bloodshot eye.

            Whistler stands bare-chested before a corroded mirror,
            splashing water from a sink over his face, rinsing off
            shaving cream residue.  He inspects his features -- he's
            cleaned himself up a bit, trimmed his beard, etc.

            He pulls on a fresh shirt, then turns to face Blade, who
            stands behind him.

            Blade smiles.  That was as close to a thank-you as this old
            junkyard dog is ever going to give.

<b>            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BACKSTORAGE AREA - DAY

            Whistler has fired up a Lucky Strike.  He's moving through
            the storage area where much of his old equipment has been
            shelved, pulling tarps off, checking things.  Blade follows.

                      expect anything else.

            Whistler takes a long drag, expelling the smoke slowly,
            studying the cigarette in his hand.

            Just then we hear the SOUND of an industrial lathe firing up.
            Curious, Whistler exits into --

<b>            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - DAY

            The workshop proper.  Scud is working at Whistler's old
            lathe, bopping his head along to MUSIC which is playing on a
            nearby TV.  The them song to SPEED RACER.  Now he's wearing a

            Whistler cocks an incredulous eyebrow at Blade, who has
            fallen in beside him.  Scud kills the lathe and approaches.

            Scud offers his hand.  Whistler doesn't take it.  Scud shoots
            an uneasy glance at Blade, raising an eyebrow in question.
            Is Whistler okay, or not?  Blade nods.  Whistler moves over
            to the Charger which has its hood up.

            Whistler gets in Scud's face.  Scud looks to Blade for help,
            but he just watches, letting the two of them sort things out.

                      sucking blood clots for the last year

                      vampire sitcom!

            Scud attempts to show some balls, but stammers all the same.

                      stain.

            Just then, however, an alarm starts BEEPING.  Scud checks a

            Scud looks to a bank of security monitors -- the views break
            into static as a FIGURE rushes past them.  He tries a few
            keyboard commands.

                      out pretty well.

            Whistler moves to a rack of weaponry.  As he reaches for CAR
            15, Scud moves to stop him.

                      trusting you with a weapon just yet.

            Whistler SMACKS Scud in the face with the butt of the CAR-15
            and pushes past him.  We hear a CRASH.

<b>            ANGLE ON

            Running on all fours, racing upside down across the ceiling
            at break-neck speed.  Then they drop, somersaulting down
            fifty feet, landing in a cat-like stance.

            Scud, with his nose now bleeding, activates a series of
            stadium-style lights secured to the ceiling.  The entire
            place goes white with UV light, the image nearly blowing out.

<b>            CLOSE ON FIGURES' FACES

            They are wearing metal goggles with iris shut to mere pin
            prick openings.

            Whistler trains the CAR-15 on --

<b>            THE FIRST LATEX CLAD FIGURE
</b>
            Who is now removing something from a satchel.  Whistler
            FIRES.  The Intruder drops the object and cartwheels away.

            In the blink of an eye, the Second Intruder has launched
            himself at Whistler, hand-springing off the floor, then
            kicking him in the mid-section.  As Whistler falls back, the
            Second Intruder presses forward.

<b>            ON BLADE
</b>
            Unsheathing his sword, rushing at the First Intruder.

            WHAP!  The Intruder traps Blade's forearm, pivoting, planting
            a boot in Blade's ribcage.  Obviously, the Intruder is a
            serious martial arts student.

            WHAP!WHAP!WHAP!  The two of them go at it, unleashing a
            flurry of kicks, blocks, and punches.  The Intruder gets
            Blade in a back-choke.  He twists out of it, throwing the
            Intruder over his shoulder, who neatly cartwheels, springing
            back off the wall at Blade again --

            Blade ducks beneath one of the Intruder's kicks, then traps
            the Intruder's foot, giving it a savage twist.  CRACK!  Blade
            backhands the intruder with a blow so strong that it knocks
            the Intruder to his knees.  Then the Intruder reaches for a
            short sword.  In a heartbeat, the sword is out and against
            Blade's throat.  Just as Blade's sword is not against the
            Intruder's.  It's a stalemate.

<b>                                SECOND INTRUDER
</b>                      Stop!!!!!

            Blade and the First Intruder freeze.  The Second Intruder
            steps away from Whistler, whom he clearly had the drop on,
            and tosses the CAR-15 to the ground.

<b>                                SECOND INTRUDER (CONT'D)

                      to deliver a message.

            Blade looks back to the First Intruder.  Then slowly
            withdraws his sword.  The Intruder does the same.  Blade
            turns off the God-lights.  The UVs fade and normal lighting
            returns.  Scud and Whistler pick themselves up off the floor.

            The Intruders remove their masks.  The first is ASAD, a
            cautious Sufi Muslim possessing a restrained nobility.

            The second is a woman, NYSSA.  20-something, with emerald
            eyes and strong, darkly exotic features.  Both are Vampire.

                      ruling body of Vampire nation.  They're
                      offering you a truce.  They want to meet
                      with you.

                      Bullshit.

            Blade holds up his hand, silencing Scud's outburst.  He nods
            for Nyssa and Asad to continue.

            Nyssa slowly crouches and reaches for the object she dropped
            - a CD.  She tosses it to Blade.  Still keeping an eye on
            them, Blade slips the CD into a reader.  We SEE a slide-show
            of video capture shots taken from a surveillance camera.

            Blade, Whistler, and Scud stand near the ledge, while Asad
            stands a few yards off, talking on a phone.  Nyssa stands
            even further away, watching them with distrust.

            As if on cue, we hear the THRUM of helicopters.  Seconds
            later, two Bell Jet Rangers appear above them, illuminating
            them in their searchlight.

<b>            INT. JET RANGER - NIGHT

            Blade and Nyssa sit in the rear of the first helicopter.

                      Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly,
                      I'm disappointed.
                          (Blade raises an eyebrow)
                      That you were willing to come along so
                      easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.

            Blade smiles and opens his coat, gesturing to a bandolier of
            plastic explosives secured to his chest.

<b>                                BLADE

            The helicopter abruptly banks right, dropping down low.

<b>            EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT
</b>
            The Bell Jet Rangers touch down outside a terraced, Frank
            Lloyd Wright structure overlooking the ocean.  As Nyssa and
            Asad lead Blade, Whistler and Scud towards the facility we
            SEE a circular crimson logo encircling a double-helix.

            Scud notices a series of RED LIGHT DOTS on his arms and
            chest.  He looks up to see DOZENS OF VAMPIRE MARKSMEN on the
            roofs above, training their weapons on them.

            Nyssa and Asad lead them into a hub out of which multiple
            corridors project.  They take the central corridor.

<b>            INT. STEEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
            The corridor ends at a pair of steel security doors.  Nyssa
            stands before a biometric scanner, allowing a beam of light
            to play over her face.  The scanner acknowledges her identity
            and the doors HISS open, revealing a series of security doors
            beyond these which successively open into --

<b>            A FINAL DOOR
</b>
            Oak, set into a stainless steel wall.  Incalculably ancient,
            elaborately carved.  Brought over from the "Old World."

                      lies here --

            As they move towards the final door, Whistler shivers.  Scud
            watches as his breath escapes from his mouth in a frosty
            plume.  Asad takes notice.

            columns from Middle Kingdom Egypt, stacks of arcane volumes,
            Medieval frontispieces.  A Borgia-esque Renaissance portrait
            staring down at us with a severe gaze.  Towering over all of
            these is a massive Greek Cross carved from stone.  MUSIC
            echoes around them -- Boito's Faust.  Standing in the midst

            Damaskinos draws closer now, stepping into the light.  Bright
            eyed with smile like moonlight gleaming off a knife blade.
            His skin is impossibly pale, almost marble-like, with
            traceries of blue blood pulsing underneath.

            Blade and the others turn to Nyssa, who uses a complex
            mechanical key to activate a holo-projector mounted above the
            table.  As she focuses the image, a 3-D DIORAMA of vampire
            viral nucleocapsids swirls into view.  The nucelocapsids
            begin attacking human red blood cells.

                      In this case, vampires are the vector.
                      The virus replicates within the human

            As Nyssa talks, one of the viral nucleocapsids changes,
            mutating from its original, elegant design into a harsher,
            more menacing form.
            The mutated nucleocapsid begins feeding on the original
            vampire capsids, causing a chain-reaction of mutation.  In
            seconds, the holo-image is filled with throbbing, microscopic

            Whistler moves away.  Blade shrugs off his jacket, begins
            putting away his weapons.  Scud lingers, apprehensive.

            Scud follows Blade's gaze, watching Whistler, who has
            collapsed into a chair at the far end of the workshop.  The
            grizzled hunter pulls off his leg brace, then massages his

            moving across the floor towards his position.  He shifts in
            his chair, moving slightly --

            Away from the light.

            It's late.  An ice-encased streetlight HUMS and flickers.
            The pumps are vacant.  A heavy blanket of sooty snow covers
            the grounds of the station.  The fluorescents of the mini
            mart are the only beacon of light in an otherwise fog-bound
            night.

<b>            INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT
</b>
            A KOREAN WOMAN (30s) mans the counter.  Her TODDLER sits in a
            circular safety walker nearby.  The kind that rolls and is
            affixed with toys to keep a baby occupied.  The woman glances
            at two surveillance monitors.  On the first monitor we see --

<b>            A CAR
</b>
            pull up to the pumps outside.  A MAN gets out, slides his
            credit card through the reader, starts pumping gas.

<b>            ON THE SECOND MONITOR
</b>
            We SEE a FIGURE standing at the back by the Slurpee machine.
            The figure turns, approaching.  It's Nomak.  He sets a
            package of gum on the counter, looks to the baby.  He smiles,
            wriggles his finger.  The child COOS and smiles back.

            Unnerved by Nomak, the Korean woman quickly rings the
            transaction, gives him his change.  He removes a stick of gum
            from the pack, carefully unwraps it, slides it into his
            mouth, watching the child all the while.  Finally, he nods to
            the woman and leaves.  The door CHIMES as he exits.

            Beat.  The woman looks to the surveillance monitors again.

<b>            THE FIRST MONITOR
</b>
            The car is still there, but the man pumping gas is gone.

            Puzzled, the woman steps from behind the counter and moves to
            the glass doors, looking out --

<b>            HER POV
</b>
            The car's driver side door hangs open.  Even more disturbing,
            the hose for the gas pump lies untended on the icy ground,
            spilling fuel from its nozzle.

<b>            EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
</b>
            The Korean woman cautiously exits the mini-mart.  No one is
            in sight.  She hurries to the abandoned car, disengaging the
            lock on the pump handle, then setting it back in its cradle.
            She looks to the open driver's door.  A FEW DROPLETS OF BLOOD
            have stained the snow just outside it.  Then she sees --

<b>            A GHOSTLY FIGURE
</b>
            Standing off in the fog-bound shadows.  The woman looks back
            to the mini-mart, then back again to where the figure was
            standing.  But the figure is gone!  Growing increasingly
            anxious, the woman hurries back.

<b>            INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
</b>
            The woman shuts the door, locks it.  But she's still just a
            target standing inside a well-lit glass box.  She moves to
            the safety walker, scoops up her child.

            After another moment's indecision, she slides the accordion
            style gate down over the doors and windows.  Then she turns
            off the lights.  Feeling somewhat more secure, the woman
            moves back around the counter and SEES --

            An unwrapped stick of gum resting on the tray of the baby
            walker.  It wasn't there before.  With a rising sense of
            dread, the woman backs away, bumping right into --

<b>            NOMAK
</b>
            He smiles cruelly, the scar/seam in his chin just beginning
            to part.  The woman gasps, turns to run --

            and bumps into THREE MORE REAPERS.  Gaunt and feral-looking.
            All three with shaved heads.
            No eyebrows, and hairline scar/seams running down their
            chins.  As one, the reapers descend on her.  We hear the

            Blade is just finishing injecting himself with serum.  He
            sighs, falling back into the chair he's sitting in, waiting
            for the shakes to subside.  He unwraps a piece of rubbing
            tubing which he'd been using as a tourniquet, flexes his
            hand.

            The door to his room opens.  Scud stands there in silhouette.

            curvaceous beauty with bee-stung lips that exudes a predatory
            sexuality.

            (NOTE: Verlaine looks familiar because she is the twin sister
            of Raquel, the bodacious vamp played by Traci Lords that
            Blade killed in the opening scene of the first film.)

            Blade pulls out one of his silver stakes.  In response, the

            around his fingers.  Then tosses it to Reinhardt.

            Blade grabs Reinhardt's wrist, pulling the stake against his
            chest, fixing the vampire with the deadliest of poker gazes.

            Reinhardt tenses, thrusting the stake forward -- but Blade
            has already whirled out of the way, trapping his hand, then
            violently twisting it backwards.

            Before Reinhardt even knows what's happening, Blade swings
            him around into a headlock.  In his free hand he's got a
            tiny, barbed flechette.  The barbs spring open like a tick's
            gripping mandibles as Blade drives the flechette into the
            base of Reinhardt's skull.  Reinhardt HOWLS in pain, but
            Blade just tightens his grip, choking off Reinhardt's air.

            Reinhardt lets loose a choked GRUNT.  Blade releases him,
            dropping the GASPING AUSTRIAN to the floor.

                      filled with silver nitrate grains.  They
                      pack a major kinetic energy dump.  And
                      since you suckheads don't like sunlight,
                      we've modified the entry lights with UV
                      filters --

            Whistler flicks on the entry light.  Then notices that Chupa
            isn't paying attention.  The vampire is looking at Snowman
            who is saying something in sign-language.  Chupa snickers.
            Whistler picks up a massive gun with a modified C-mag
            (hundred round cylindrical mag).  It has a strange electromag
            assembly barrel with shockwave ports running along it.

<b>            MOMENTS LATER
</b>
            Blade, Whistler, and the Bloodpack are silently suiting up
            for war -- strapping on body armor, securing stakes and
            knives, CLICKING ammo cartridges into their various weapons.

            We SEE them lacing up combat boots, checking rifle sights,
            entry lights.  Blade dons one of his EDTA pneumatic
            gauntlets.  Whistler loads custom rounds into a shotgun.
            Then he reaches to clip on an ammo vest.  But his hands are
            shaking slightly and he can't seem to clip the locking
            mechanism together.  After a beat, Blade reaches over and
            does it for Whistler.  Like a son helping his father.  A beat
            passes between them, Whistler and Blade looking at one
            another.  Then Whistler nods, satisfied.

            As Blade crosses towards Asad and Nyssa, he stops by
            Verlaine, sizing her up.

<b>            EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</b>
            Blade, Whistler, and the Bloodpack are gathered on a rooftop
            overlooking a derelict city block.

<b>            THE HOUSE OF PAIN
</b>
            Rises before them, a Gothic Revival hotel marred by graffiti
            scrawls and boarded up windows.  There's a large neon "HOTEL"
            sign on the side of the building.

<b>                                NYSSA
</b>                      From what we can gather, the Reapers
                      hunt in packs, targeting places where
                      vampires congregate.  So far, they've
                      attacked bloodbanks, safehouses,
                      underground clubs like this --

            Whistler lifts up a pair of night-vision binoculars and scans
            the building.

<b>            WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH BINOCULARS)
</b>
            He scans the graffiti scrawls, doesn't see anything.

<b>                                NYSSA

<b>            WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH BINOCULARS)
</b>
            Whistler switches to infra-red.  A previously unseen Vampire
            GLYPH is now revealed, hidden amongst the haphazard graffiti.
            Just beneath the glyph are a pair of loading doors set flush
            into the concrete sidewalk.

                      Let's put this clusterfuck in gear.

            Reinhardt reaches for Whistler, stopping him.

            Before things can escalate, Blade steps between them.

            Whistler considers Blade's words, then reluctantly nods.
            Blade rejoins the vampires.  Reinhardt grins.

            Blade pulls out the remote for the flechette in Reinhardt's
            head, holding it up for view.

<b>            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</b>
            Nyssa leads the group into a loading area.  The only light is
            coming from a series of burning trashcans.  VAMPIRE SENTRIES
            crouch on the steps, watching, smelling Nyssa's group as they
            move past.  Adjacent areas are walled off with sheets of
            vinyl.  We hear the pulsing, bass-heavy beat of MUSIC coming
            from beyond the sheeting, beckoning us onward.

<b>            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
            The MUSIC is louder.  Neon-lit, corridor-long steel counters
            line both walls, displaying various surgical instruments
            offered as party favors.  As Blade's scans the area, we SEE
            the deadly instruments reflected in his sunglasses.  Nyssa
            looks to him.

<b>                                NYSSA

                      I haven't forgotten.

            They reach a steel loading door emblazoned with warning signs
            -- the kind that is split horizontally, one-half retracting
            into the ceiling, the other into the floor.

            On that portentous note, Nyssa hits a button.  The hydraulic

<b>            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

            A high-ceilinged ballroom packed with SWAYING BODIES.
            Retrofitted into a trance-dance hall.  Off to the sides,
            people are being pierced, tattooed, ritually scarred.  Silver
            trays piled high with razor blades are passed through the
            writhing crowd.  Everyone looks suspicious.

            AN ELABORATE S&amp;M STAGE SHOW

            is under way.  Joel Peter Witkin channeled by Julie Taymor.
            A SHE-VAMPIRE hangs from the ceiling, her body supported by
            steel pins which have been hooked through her flesh.  THREE
            PVC-clad spindly FIGURES minister to her.

                      Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring --
                      because we regenerate, none of it's
                      permanent.  So we have to take it to the
                      next level. To remind us we're alive.

            The Bloodpack fans out through the trancing crowd.

<b>            ON BLADE
</b>
            Drifting through the press of flesh.  Feral faces flash by
            us, distorted by the stroboscopic lights.  A SHE-VAMPIRE
            latches onto him.  He shoves her aside, keeps scanning faces.
            It takes every ounce of his restraint not to cut loose.

            The interior of the van has been outfitted into a mobile "op

            ephermera, munching on a bag of White Castle hamburgers.
            He's watching a video feed from a camera mounted on Blade's
            gear, listening to the Bloodpack's CHATTER coming in from
            various audio channels.  In the background, he's also got

            Whistler is atop the roof of a nearby building, outfitted

            The view pans from the hotel entrance to Scud's van.

            Whistler puts down the binoculars, lights a cigarette.  He
            takes out a knife and slices open his palm.  He stares at the
            blood, his hand slowly trembling.

<b>            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
            Blade works his way through the crowd.  The beat is getting
            heavier now, the crowd more energized.  He briefly makes eye
            contact with Nyssa, but then she's gone again, disappearing
            into the sea of flesh, ducking past one of the vinyl sheets
            into a corridor beyond.  Chupa, Asad, Snowman and Priest
            remain behind, searching the crowd.

            As Blade walks, he notices a series of grates beneath their
            feet.  We shift our POV --

<b>            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - NIGHT
</b>
            -- and we are below Blade, looking up at him through the
            grate.  We are in a blood-encrusted drainage area just
            beneath the ballroom that slopes inward towards a large,
            octagonal iron culvert.  As we watch, a section of the
            culvert rises, a pair of RED EYES peering out from the
            darkness within.

<b>            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - STAIRCASE - NIGHT
</b>
            Blade follows Nyssa up a narrow staircase into a corridor
            lined with gangrenous, peeling wallpaper.  Some of the room
            doors are shut, some open.  Clearly, many are occupied.

<b>            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
            A 1930s industrial kitchen filled with corroded equipment.
            Reinhardt, Verlaine, and Lighthammer work their way inward,
            searching the area.  Lighthammer carries massive war hammer
            like his namesake.
            Reinhardt nods to Verlaine, who opens a walk-in, shining her
            entry light over an assortment of rusting meat hooks.

<b>            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - FIRST CORRIDOR - NIGHT

            Blade checks more doorways, catching half-glimpses of FLESH,
            LEATHER, and STEEL.  He hears SOBBING, MOANS, WHISPERS.
            Then, a distinctly HUMAN WHIMPER catches his attention.

            Nyssa opens a door onto an empty room.  A vacant stainless
            steel examination table gleams in the center, waiting.

            Blade pushes open another door.  We SEE a fearful YOUNG WOMAN
            crouching in the corner of a soiled room.  A corpulent
            VAMPIRE in a leather apron is hosing down the floor.

            Blade makes eye-contact with the woman.  She's clearly human.
            Blade tenses.  The corpulent vampire is getting irate when --

            forehead.  Even as the vampire turns to ash, Blade motions
            for the girl to leave and we're out the hallway again, Nyssa
            turning around.

            Reinhardt, Verlaine, and Lighthammer.  A Styrofoam cup rolls
            across the floor, blown by a breeze.  Reinhardt pauses,
            notices another walk-in freezer door ajar, moves in that
            direction.

            Unseen behind them, a door BEHIND THEM slowly swings open.

            Chupa, Asad, Snowman and Priest.  THREE SHADOWED FIGURES are
            lurking near one of the exits -- skinhead types, each with a
            hairline scar running down their chin.
            Asad silently motions to snowman and the others, indicating
            figures.  Snowman signs something back.  The vampire trio
            starts towards them.

            Bored to shit, Scud plucks a joint from behind his ear.  As
            he fires up his woman torso lighter we HEAR SOMETHING just
            outside the van.  Scud kills the Barry White, listening.
            Silence.  Then, a FAINT SKITTERING.

            Still no response.  Scud reaches for a handgun and creeps
            into the front of the van.  He looks out the windshield --
            nothing.  He looks left, then right - nothing.

            Unnerved, Scud returns to the back of the van.  He reaches
            for the handle of the rear door and abruptly jerks the door
            open, aiming the gun out --

            There's nothing outside the van.  But then Scud hears the
            SKITTERING AGAIN.  His eyes shift apprehensively to the floor
            of the van below him.

            As they near the end of the hall, Blade notices a drop-down
            attic door in the ceiling above.  He unsheathes his sword and
            uses the tip to unlatch the trapdoor.  The counter-weighted
            door CREAKS and LOWERS, unfolding a sectioned ladder.  We see
            darkness beyond.  As Blade cautiously mounts the stairs --

            Nyssa's attention is drawn to a billowing piece of vinyl.  A
            BLURRY FIGURE is visible behind it.  Then it moves away.
            Nyssa ducks past the vinyl.

            As the music reaches a crescendo, Asad notices MORE SHADOWY
            FIGURES by another exit.  And even MORE by a third.  Snowman
            signs to Asad again, more urgently this time, as the first
            potential Reaper begins to turn and we are --

            -- back with Scud.  He ducks his head outside, looking
            beneath the van.  Nothing there.  Relieved, Scud shuts the

            Suddenly rip down through the ceiling of the van, peeling it
            up and back like it was tinfoil!  A REAPER with a bloody
            bandage covering his eye SNARLS down at us.

            The first skinhead figure spins towards us.  It's a Reaper.
            All three of them are, eyes wide with bloodlust as they leap
            at Asad and the others.

            Suddenly, the Reapers are everywhere, blocking the exits,
            ripping into their vampire victims, tossing them aside like
            toys.  Vampires scream and run, some taking to the walls as a
            means of escape, some racing across the ceiling.

            FIRES his MACH pistol point-blank into Nomak's face, blasting
            the Reaper backwards --

            But Nomak is back on his feet in a split-second, SMASHING
            through a window onto the fire escape beyond.  Blade rushes
            to the window, looks out --

            Nomak is scaling his way straight up the neon hotel sign,
            jumping from one letter to the next with lightning speed.

            A Reaper EXPLODES out from the walk-in, rather than the door
            behind them.  He leaps atop Reinhardt, SLAMMING him to the
            floor.  Lighthammer swings his hammer, missing the Reaper,
            taking out a chunk of the wall instead.
            Lighthammer swings and misses again, taking a chunk out of
            the floor.  Verlaine empties her automatic rifle into the
            Reaper even as --

            The Reaper turns on Lighthammer, catching the war hammer,
            Reaper's lower jaw disengages and splits open, revealing a
            freakishly enlarged esophagus lined with serrated, sharklike
            teeth.

            All of this takes a split-second.  No time for Lighthammer to
            react as the Reaper latches its grossly expanded mouth onto
            his throat and begins draining him before our eyes.  The
            Reaper SHUDDERS and the whites of his eyes bleed red as an
            ecstatic wave washes over him.  His pale flesh, pulsing with
            engorged veinwork, becomes flushed, turning crimson as --

            Lighthammer's face becomes increasingly pallid!  His face

            is vacuumed out of him.

            Are popping up beneath the Reaper's briefly translucent skin,
            becoming engorged and dilated.  The veins continue to swell,
            racing up his neck, then branching out over his face, chest,
            and arms -- like an instant network of varicose veins.

            Verlaine retreats, horrified.  Reinhardt scurries backwards,

            Scud unloads his handgun into the Reaper atop the van.  The
            Reaper should turn to ash, but it doesn't!  Scud flees,
            DIVING into the front of the van, ducking behind the wheel.
            He keys the ignition --

            WHAM!  Now the Reaper is atop the hood, SMASHING his feet
            through the windshield.  Scud SCREAMS as he slams the van
            into the drive and floors the pedal --

            WK-KRUNCH!  Scud CRASHES the van against the side of a
            building, pinning the Reaper between the van's front bumper
            and the crumbling wall.  He keeps his foot on the gas pedal,
            GRINDING the van's wheels.

            This gambit should cut the Reaper in half, or at the very
            least, fatally wound it -- but it only enrages it further.
            The Reaper stretches forward across the van's crumpled hood

            Priest fires a Glaser round through the she-Reaper's head.
            The Reaper twists in mid-leap, falls to the floor, then picks
            herself up again.  Like Scud's Reaper, she seems unaffected
            by the custom-made ammo.

            repeatedly.  Two projectiles fire out, chained together by a
            length of titanium cable.  The cable catches the Reaper in
            the mid-section, cutting it clean in half!

            The upper half of the Reaper falls, then rights itself,

            Nomak abruptly stops, having reached the end of the roof.
            The nearest neighboring rooftop is too far away and the drop
            from this last ledge looks unsurvivable, even for someone
            like Nomak.

            As Blade cautiously advances, Nomak turns around and smiles --
            a wolfish grin, unnaturally wide.  The Reaper's face is
            beginning to smoke beneath the rising sun's rays.  In
            response, a polarized nictomembrane slides down over Nomak's
            irises -- like something you'd see on a crocodile to protect
            its eyes from harsh light.

            Nomak LAUGHS, then LUNGES, scooping up a rusty iron bar that
            lies nearby.  He swings it at Blade.  Blade parries and steps
            backward, taking a blow to the head in the process, then
            another to the side.

            The two of them exchange a flurry of blows back and forth
            until their weapons lock and they are face to face.  Nomak's
            back is to the rising sun, now.  His whole body is beginning
            to lightly smoke.

            Both men are trembling, straining against their weapons,
            using every ounce of strength to keep the other at bay.  And
            just when it looks like Nomak is gaining the upper hand --

            Nomak's eyes!

            Nomak SCREAMS and rears back, his face catching fire.  Then
            he stumbles backwards and falls -- right off the ledge of the
            roof!  Blade hurries to the roof's ledge and looks down --

            But the Reaper is nowhere in sight.  Dumbfounded, Blade

            Priest lets loose an agonized SCREAM as Blade and the others
            gather around him.  He's undergoing a horrific change, taking
            on the gaunt, vein-engorged features of a proper Reaper.  He
            SNARLS and WAILS, GNASHING his teeth like a rabid animal.

            Reinhardt and his team look uneasy.  Shaken by their
            teammate's downward progression.

            Blade draws closer.  Already, the flesh on Priest's chin is
            splitting as a seam begins to form.

            Reinhardt paces, annoyed by Priest's WAILING.

<b>                                REINHARDT
</b>                      Jesus, can't you get him to shut the

                      His blood cells aren't producing oxygen
                      anymore.  His own body is suffocating
                      him.  These things are like crack
                      addicts.  If they don't feed every few
                      hours, they'll feed on themselves.

            As if in response, Priest starts convulsing.  His flesh
            tightens, drawing taut around his increasingly skeletal form.
            His screams become unbearable, twisting into a high-pitched
            ululation that's making the Bloodpack's skin crawl.

            Asad pulls out his handgun and empties the clip into Priest's
            body -- but Priest keeps SHRIEKING.

            Unnerved, Reinhardt unsheathes a machete, decapitating Priest
            even as the others protest.

            The headless body continues thrashing, still making noise
            from it's open throat!  If anything, it seems to be
            redoubling its efforts.  It LURCHES forward, jerking itself
            free from Chupa and Snowman's restraining arms.

<b>                                CHUPA
</b>                      Mierda!!

            The juddering horror that used to be Priest staggers to its
            feet.  Reinhardt and his men panic, stumbling backwards.  The
            headless monstrosity LUNGES STRAIGHT AT --

<b>            BLADE
</b>
            Without batting an eye, he draws his MACH pistol, briefly
            aiming at the on-rushing creature's chest, then adjusting his
            aim to one of the blacked-out windows above and behind it.

            BAM!BAM!BAM!  Blade shoots out the window and BLAZING SHAFT
            OF SUNLIGHT slices down through the darkness, spotlighting
            Priest like an ant beneath a magnifying glass.

            FWASH!!!  The headless body is incinerated in mid-step.  It
            collapses to the floor, just inches before Blade.  One of its
            blackened claws feebly grabs Blade's boot, then grows still.

            Beat.  You could hear the pin drop in the silence that
            follows, every one of the Bloodpack thinking some variation
            of "there but for the grace of God go I".  Asad lays a hand
            on Nyssa's shoulder, steadying her.

            Blade shifts his foot, causing the cinder-like hand gripping
            his boot to crumble to dust.

            Blade looks over to see Whistler, who is just entering.  He
            moves over to him, angry.  Chupa follows, equally pissed.

            Chupa flushes with anger and flicks his knife across
            Whistler's shoulder, opening a gash.  Whistler goes ballistic
            and PUNCHES Chupa in the face.  A brief tussle ensues before
            Blade and the others can separate them.  As Chupa is pulled
            away by Asad, he looks back at Whistler.

<b>            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Whistler, Blade and the surviving members of the Bloodpack
            are now gathered around the octagonal iron culvert just
            beneath the ballroom.  Whistler turns on a flashlight.  We
            HEAR something moving in the darkness.  The group tenses,
            then Whistler's flashlight beam reveals --

<b>            A REAPER
</b>
            Cowering by the culvert.  One we recognize.  The other
            vampire guard from the bloodbank, now transformed.  He's
            shrunken and emaciated, pale.  And although he's obviously
            dying, he still HISSES, his fanged mouth snapping
            ineffectually at them.  His arm has been trapped -- pinned
            under one of the sectional culvert coverings.  It looks like
            he's been trying to gnaw it off in order to escape.

<b>                                REINHARDT

</b>                      I found him like this.  I think he was
                      trying to crawl back into that culvert.

            Blade looks to the culvert in question.  He pulls back one of
            the sectioned covers.  The opening is about two feet wide,
            just large enough for a man to gain access.

<b>            INT. SEWER/OUTFLOW AREA - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Blade drops into the sewer line.  The area is claustrophobic,
            damp.  There are torn pieces of insulation hanging from the
            ceiling, saturated and dripping with blood.

            Blade crouch-walks further in.  We hear WIND.  He shines his
            FLASHLIGHT.  A portion of the brick wall looks like it's been
            clawed open.

<b>                                NYSSA

                      Everything okay?

            Blade retreats back to the drain-pipe, pulling himself back
            up.  We HOLD for a beat, then drift up to the blood-saturated
            strips of insulation.  SOMEONE is crouched in the shadows
            there, clinging to the ceiling upside down.

            It's NOMAK, red-eyes shining in the darkness.

<b>            INT. DAMASKINO'S LAIR - BATHHOUSE - DAY
</b>
            We are in a previously unseen portion of Damaskino's vast
            bedroom.  An elegantly tiled pool area has been partitioned
            off by a series of latticed screens.  In the counterpoint to
            this are a series of muted monitors tuned to the pulse of the
            world -- CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN, etc.

            Damaskinos sits in a robe, finishing a meal, his eyes
            flicking over the monitors -- tracking current events, market
            fluctuations.  We get the sense that the man is a true
            polymath.  That he owes his five thousand-plus years of
            existence to resourcefulness rather than luck.

            Stevens enters, waiting to be acknowledged.

                      Two so far.

            Unconcerned, Damaskinos slices into a piece of raw meat.

</b>                      Any game worthy of being played is.  One

                      outlived my enemies.  All of them.

            Damaskinos steps beyond the screens now, into the pool area --
            and although we can't see the water from this angle, we can
            see patterns of ruby light flickering off the tiled walls.
            Stevens follows, uncomfortable.

<b>                                STEVENS
</b>                      Blade's too volatile.  You're not going
                      to be able to keep manipulating him --

            Damaskinos steps into the steaming liquid, which we now see
            is BLOOD.  His robe spreads out, floating on the surface.

<b>                                DAMASKINOS
</b>                      You worry too much, Stevens.  I have
                      assurance from our friend inside that

<b>                                STEVENS
</b>                      As scripted?  You've already lost two of
                      your own.  How many more are you willing
                      to sacrifice?

            Damaskinos sinks until he's waist-deep in the crimson fluid.

<b>                                DAMASKINOS

                      Do you see that jar over there?

            Stevens looks to a shelf where a gold and crystal Coptic jar
            rests.  A HUMAN HEART floats within.

            The dying Reaper has now been chained inside the cell.  It
            WHEEZES and MOANS, clearly in agony.  Blade and Nyssa stand
            watch.  Blade grips the Reaper beneath its jaw, turning its
            face towards us.

                      There's something driving him beyond the

            As they watch, the Reaper shakes through its final death
            throes, then grows still, the nictomembranes over its eyes
            slowly sliding down.

            A pair of GLOVED HANDS spreads apart the Reaper's eyelids.
            In response, the protective nictomembrane slides mechanically
            down over the pupil.

                      camel.  Shields the eyes from sunlight.

            The hands now part the Reaper's mouth, probing the seam in
            the chin, then splitting the mandible apart to reveal the
            enlarged esophagus.  The fingers push back on the gums and
            the pressure-sensitive fangs extend even further in response.

            Blade sits in the shadows, wrapping a piece of rubber tubing
            around his arm, injecting himself with pneumatic syringe of
            serum.  He shivers, convulses violently, then throws back his
            head in relief.  When he does so, he SEES --

            Whistler standing in the doorway.  They eye each other a
            moment as Blade unwraps the tubing from his arm, puts away
            his syringe and serum.  Whistler lights a cigarette, then
            nods through a window towards Nyssa and the others.

            Whistler turns and strides exits.  We HOLD ON Blade, torn,
            conflicted, watching Whistler retreat.

<b>            EXT. BLADE'S WAREHOUSE/SHIPYARD - NIGHT
</b>
            We SEE a FIGURE emerge from the shadows -- CHUPA.

<b>            EXT. CITY SLUM - NIGHT
</b>
            Chupa walks the night, scanning shadows.

<b>            CHUPA'S POV (VAMPIRE VISION)

            Like heat-vision, only tinged with crimson.  There are DRUG
            DEALERS and bottom feeding WHORES trolling for tricks out
            here, BEATING HEARTS and BRANCHING ARTERIES highlighted on
            their ghostly silhouettes.

            Chupa moves to the mouth of an alley, nodding to a DEALER.

<b>                                DEALER

<b>                                CHUPA
</b>                      What you got?

            As the dealer glances around to see if anyone's watching --

<b>                                DEALER
</b>                      Horse, Hawaiian ice.  Whatever you want.

            Chupa sniffs the air, glancing at a pulsating vein on the
            dealer's neck, and smiles.

<b>                                CHUPA
</b>                      Whatever, huh?  Well I'm all off the
                      hook on that bitch.

            Chupa steps into the alley with the dealer.

<b>                                DEALER
</b>                      So what's it gonna be?

<b>                                CHUPA
</b>                      Fear.

            Chupa is at the dealer's throat before he can finish,
            flashing his fangs, shoving him backwards.  Then --

<b>                                CHUPA (CONT'D)

<b>            WHAP!  A HAND
</b>
            Grabs a fistful of Chupa's hair, jerking his head back.  It's
            Blade.  He yanks Chupa off the dealer.

</b>                      Trying to feed, puto baboso!

            The dealer takes off as Blade swings Chupa around.  They
            exchange a couple of blows, then Blade knees him in the
            balls, twisting him around by his arm, dislocating it.

            Blade releases Chupa, shoving him forward.  Chupa's broken
            arm dangles awkwardly.  Furious, Chupa reaches for his .45
            with his good hand -- only to hear the CLICK of another gun
            as it's placed against the back of his head.

                      just wondering if you have.

            Chupa re-holsters his gun, then jams his dislocated arm up
            against the wall and resets it.  He backs away.  Nyssa
            watches him leave, looks to Blade.

                      justify saving people like that?

            Blade doesn't answer, just moves away.  She follows.

            Scud jiggles the necklace of fangs around his neck.

            Scud triggers the modified entry light.  The light PULSES
            like a series of flash-bulbs going off, creating a
            stroboscopic effect as a wafer-thin, super-concentrated BLUE
            BEAM OF LIGHT slices through the shadows.  Scud looks to
            Whistler and smiles.

<b>            EXT. CITYSCAPE - PRE-DAWN
</b>
            Beyond the shadowed skyline of monolithic buildings, the
            night is beginning to give way to dawn.

<b>            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - PRE-DAWN
</b>
            Scud stands before the others.  He looks bleary-eyed but
            pleased with the night's work.  The fruit of their efforts
            are laid on a work table before them -- a half-dozen UV laser
            guns, along with a collection of UV flashbang grenades and a
            much bigger explosive device secured into a backpack carrier.

            Blade picks up one of the UV lasers.  He sights down the
            length of it.  Scud takes a power pack and slaps into the
            base of Blade's gun.

<b>                                SCUD
</b>                      The powerpacks have a limited charge,
                      maybe ten minutes of continuous use at
                      most.

            Nyssa gestures to the flashbang grenades.

<b>                                NYSSA
</b>                      What are these?

                           carrier)
                      This is for the grand finale.  Wired
                      together a couple-dozen of those
                      puppies.  But I'd be careful where you
                      pop your load.  Might end up frying
                      yourselves in the process.

            Asad looks to Blade.

<b>                                ASAD
</b>                      What good is all this firepower if we

            Blade looks to Nyssa, who tosses Reinhardt an aerosol
            cannister.  He sprays a little, then wrinkles his nose in
            disgust, gagging.

</b>
<b>            INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - DAWN
</b>
            Beneath the ballroom gratings.  A high-angle shot looking
            down at the octagonal iron culvert around which Blade,
            Whistler, and the remainder of the Bloodpack are gathered.
            The mechanized, sectional portions of the culvert covering
            are GRINDING UPWARD, flowering open and apart like some blood
            and rust-encrusted gateway to Hell.

<b>            INT. SEWER/OUTFLOW AREA - DAWN
</b>
            One by one, the group of hunters descend into the
            claustrophobic chamber.  Verlaine is lugs the UV bomb on her
            back.  Blade leads them to the clawed-open portion of the
            brick wall, then on through.

<b>            INT. SEWER LINE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
            Blade leads the group along a grime-encrusted line which
            slopes gradually downward, sloshing through ankle-deep run
            off water collected from the city above them.  Tendrils of
            mist drift about, cutting their field of vision even further.
            Here and there, thin SHAFTS of SUNLIGHT cut down through
            cracks in the street above, requiring the vampires to
            cautiously circumvent them.

            They reach a four-way intersection of tunnels.  Blade pauses.

<b>                                BLADE
</b>                      Time for Nyssa's pheromones.

            Blade opens a statchel.  Inside are a dozen distinctive
            aluminum atomizers.  He hands them out to the others.
            Whistler triggers a can, spraying a thin mist over his face,
            wrinkling his noses in disgust.

<b>                                WHISTLER

                      Try to maintain radio silence from here
                      on out.

            Blade points to Chupa and Whistler, indicating the Eastern
            tunnel.  They head off.  Next, Blade directs Nyssa, Asad,
            Snowman, and Verlaine down the Western tunnel.  Blade nods to
            Reinhardt and starts down the Northern branch.

<b>            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            It's darker here, no shafts of sunlight slicing down from
            above.  Whistler turns on his UV entry light.  Chupa reaches
            out with his hand, partially blocking the beam.

<b>                                CHUPA

            As the shifting patterns of light and shadow play across
            Chupa's face we SEE his pupils contract and dilate
            unnaturally large in response.

<b>                                CHUPA (CONT'D)

                      What am I supposed to do?

            Chupa tosses Whistler a pair of night-vision goggles.

</b>                      Bifocals, grandpa.  And try to keep up.

            Chupa heads into the darkness, moving with uncanny speed.

<b>            INT. TUNNELS - VARIOUS
</b>
            We intercut between the three teams now, back and forth as
            they progress deeper into the city's bowels.

<b>            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            Blade and Reinhardt trudge along.  The tunnel slopes inward,
            forming a V-shaped channel where a trickle of water flows.
            Blade notices SOMETHING bobbing in the water.  He nudges it
            with his foot and knocks it free.  It's a broken HUMAN TIBIA
            which twirls around, then flows past their legs.

            A few steps later on, Reinhardt notices SOMETHING ELSE.  He
            stoops into waist-deep water, picking up what he thinks is an
            isolated HUMAN RIB -- but ends up snagging a tangled mass of
            hair, mud, and bones.

<b>            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            Whistler and Chupa move side by side.  Chupa is anxious, eyes
            darting about.  Occasionally, they come upon a transection
            with smaller conduits leading off to the right and the left.
            Then they reach a stooped, narrower tunnel and have to move
            single file.

            Suddenly, a BLAST of LIGHT and THUNDEROUS SOUND explodes
            above them.  They look up --

<b>                                WHISTLER
</b>                          (startled)
                      Shit!

            A subway TRAIN rockets by on a track just above them,
            pummeling them with soot and dust.

            Unseen by them, briefly illuminated by the flashing subway
            lights we see three Reaper faces, pale and haunting, hanging
            upside down.

<b>            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            Blade and Reinhardt reach a dead-end where the tunnel has
            caved in.  A BERM OF HUMAN BONES slopes upward from the water
            -- skulls and ribs, vertebrae, tibias, metatarsi.  Blade
            kneels, inspecting them.  There are gnaw marks on them.

<b>                                BLADE

                      underestimated how many Reapers you're

<b>            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            As Nyssa, Snowman, Verlaine, and Asad cautiously move
            forward, Nyssa GASPS, startled by --

            HALF A DOZEN REAPERS laying on the tunnel floor before them
            in a stagnant pool of sewage water.  Dead.

<b>            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            Back with Whistler and Chupa, Whistler is in the lead.

<b>                                CHUPA (O.S.)
</b>                      Hey,hillbilly.

            As Whistler turns around, Chupa SLAMS Whistler in the side of
            the head, swiping his night-vision goggles off.  As Whistler
            vainly searches for his goggles.

<b>                                WHISTLER
</b>                      What the fuck you doing?

                      time as any to settle up.

            Chupa moves stealthily in darkness, violently KICKING the
            older man.  Whistler tries to crawl away, then reaches for
            his pheromone atomizer and locks it in the "on-position".  As
            Chupa continues to lay into Whistler we SEE the atomizer roll
            away, dispensing its contents.

<b>            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

<b>            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            Nyssa nods to Asad and Verlaine.  They train their UV lasers
            on the area where the Reaper corpses were -- but the Reaper
            bodies are gone.  And so is Snowman for that matter.

            Just then, we hear a NOISE from above.  Nyssa and the others
            whip their UV lasers in that direction.

</b>
            CLOSE ON the pheromone atomizer, the spray petering out.
            Whistler is beat to shit, bleeding from his mouth.  Chupa
            reaches for his handgun, whipping it out just as --

            Whistler's hands brush the damaged night vision goggles.  He
            swings them upward.

<b>            WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH GOGGLES)
</b>
            Whistler has just enough time to register Chupa, the handgun
            pointed directly at him/us before noticing SOMETHING ELSE
            just beyond Chupa.

<b>            A DOZEN REAPERS
</b>
            Clinging to the ceiling above.  They drop down on Chupa like
            a pack of rabid dogs, literally tearing him in half.

<b>            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)
</b>
            Hearing GUNFIRE and SCREAMS, Blade charges back in Whistler's
            direction as --

<b>            THE BERM OF HUMAN BONES
</b>
            EXPLODE apart.  Reapers CHARGE towards them, hitting Blade in
            the chest, driving him backwards.  As Blade falls, his entry
            light swings upward, illuminating.

<b>            ANOTHER REAPER
</b>
            Drops down atop Reinhardt, knocking his UV gun into the
            water.  We SEE even MORE REAPERS converging in on them from
            the side tunnels in a cacophony of SHADOW and NOISE.

<b>            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)
</b>
            Verlaine, Nyssa and Asad are FIRING their UV lasers.  The
            pumping flashes of their guns throw crazy shadows in every
            direction.  Adding to the unbridled chaos of strobing light
            and NOISE.  More and more Reapers are swarming towards them,
            moving towards us at an unearthly clip!  Nyssa and her
            compatriots retreat, running for their lives.

<b>            A REAPER
</b>
            Leaps, landing on Verlaine's back.  It grabs her head and
            deftly SNAPS her spine in half with a sickening CRUNCH!

<b>            INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)
</b>
            Whistler panics, backing away from the SOUNDS of the reapers
            slaughtering Chupa.  He finds his gun, flicks on the UV entry
            light --

            And just like that, the attacking reapers have vanished.
            Whistler whirls about, sweeping the UV beam around, but all
            he SEES is darkness.

            Then, a bone-chilling WHISPER cuts through the shadows.

<b>                                NOMAK (O.S.)
</b>                      Whistler.

            Whistler spins.  NOMAK RIGHT BEHIND HIM.  As Whistler whips
            the UV gun up, Nomak stops it.  The beam is mere millimeters
            from the Reaper's face -- close enough to illuminate his
            nightmarish features, but not close enough to burn.

<b>                                NOMAK (CONT'D)
</b>                      If you survive this, tell your master.
                      My end is my beginning.

            In an eyeblink, Nomak is gone.  Whistler spins, shining the
            UV this way and that.  Alone in the dark.

<b>            INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            Blade FIRES his UV into a Reaper's torso.  As the Reaper
            incinerates, Blade spins, FIRING at a second Reaper --

<b>            ON REINHARDT
</b>
            Firing his non-UV weapon.  Two Reapers are closing in on him.

<b>                                BLADE
</b>                      Take mine!

            Blade throws Reinhardt his UV laser and unsheathes his sword.
            Reinhardt sweeps the lethal beam over the two reapers.

            Blade retreats back into the water, calm, letting the
            creatures comes to him.  As they close in on him, he slips
            the tip of the sword beneath the surface of the water,
            waiting --

            As one, the Reapers converge on Blade.  He swings his sword
            up from the water, hacking away at them, using their own
            momentum against them.

            Reinhardt considers his options.  He decides to run for it --

<b>                                BLADE (CONT'D)
</b>                      Reinhardt!

            Reinhardt races away, abandoning Blade.  Blade reaches for
            one of the UV flashbangs clipped to his harness.  He pulls
            the pin with his teeth and shoves it into an on-rushing
            Reaper's mouth as --

            Reinhardt slips on the wet concrete and --

            BANG!  Searing LIGHT fills the tunnel, instantly incinerating
            the Reaper.

            Reinhardt's unprotected face CATCHES FIRE.   He SCREAMS,
            falling back into the water, trying to douse the flames.
            ANOTHER REAPER lands atop him, dragging him down as --

<b>            INT. NORTHERN AND WESTERN TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

            We hear GUNFIRE and SCREAMS coming from all directions.
            Blade retreats.  A reaper, fully ON FIRE from the UV
            explosion, races towards him.  As Blade decapitates it:

            Asad and Nyssa also retreat.  Nyssa pulls a pin on a UV
            flashbang, throws it behind her.  BA-BANG!  UV light fills
            the tunnels and --

<b>            INT. SEWER LINE - FOUR-WAY INTERSECTION - DAY
</b>
            Blade, Nyssa, Whistler and Asad abruptly find themselves back
            in the four-way juncture, knee-deep in water.  They quickly
            regroup, out of breath, riding adrenaline highs.

                      A little too well, I'd say.

            The others turn to look in Blade's direction.

<b>            DOZENS OF RED EYES
</b>
            are staring out at them from the darkness of the Eastern
            Tunnel.  Then we hear a HISSING SOUND coming from the
            opposite direction.  Blade and the others spin around --

<b>            MORE RED-EYED REAPERS
</b>
            are closing in on them from the West.  AND THE NORTH.  AND
            THE SOUTH!  There must be forty of them in all.

                      Partridge family here.

            They retreat until they are back to back, each one of them
            covering their respective tunnel opening.

<b>            A REAPER
</b>
            Lunges at them from the North.  Asad triggers his UV laser,
            scorching the creature.  It HOWLS and slinks backwards.

<b>            TWO MORE REAPERS
</b>
            Attack from the East and the West.  Blade and Nyssa respond
            in kind, burning their assailants in mid-air.  But even as
            they fire, their UV beams weaken, the flashes of light coming
            from their barrels pulsing less frequently.

                      say we're about half a battery away from
                      a reaper gang-bang.

            The foursome are managing to keep the Reapers at bay, but
            just barely.  Blade motions to Nyssa.

<b>                                BLADE
</b>                      Give me the rest of the pheromones.

            Nyssa reaches inside her harness, handing Blade the remaining
            atomizers.  He crushes them in his fist, letting the fluid
            within spill over his face and chest.

<b>                                ASAD
</b>                      What are you doing?

            The Reapers become even more agitated, HISSING loudly,
            pressing in on them closer and closer.  Blade nods his head
            back down the Western tunnel.

<b>                                BLADE
</b>                      Verlaine's body is back there somewhere

                      guns in that direction, you'll drive an
                      opening in their ranks.  I'll run for

                      make a break for it the other way.

            Asad studies Blade with newfound respect.

                      words.  Let's do this NOW!!!

            The foursome spin, FIRING their UV lasers down the Western
            tunnel.  The Reapers SHRIEK, falling to either side, their
            bodies burning --

            Blade CHARGES FORWARD, firing his dying UV laser.  As he
            makes it past the line of Reapers, they start after him,
            driven into a frenzy by the pheromones.  The Reapers in the
            Northern and Eastern tunnels flood after Blade too, leaving --

            Nyssa, Whistler and Asad to contend with the Reapers in the
            Southern tunnel.  They discharge their weapons, shouldering
            Reapers aside, making a mad dash for freedom.

<b>            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            Blade runs, splashing and stumbling through the water, just a
            hair's breadth ahead of the HOWLING Reaper horde.  Suddenly,
            the tunnel widens out into a larger chamber.

<b>            INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            Whistler and the others FIRE BACK at the small group of
            Reapers which have followed them, rather than Blade.

<b>            ON WHISTLER
</b>
            cut off from Nyssa and Asad.  He spots a maintenance ladder
            and runs for it, dragging himself up the rungs.  A Reaper
            leaps up the ladder after him --

            Whistler reaches the top of the ladder, but his exit is
            blocked by a manhole cover!  It's STUCK!  Whistler swings up
            his shotgun, FIRING into the cover.

            The cover is BLOWN UPWARDS, sending a shaft of blinding
            sunlight down on the Reaper below him.  As the Reaper
            incinerates, Whistler scurries upwards to safety.

<b>            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL/CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
            Blade reaches Verlaine's half-submerged body.  He tears the
            backpack carrier off the dead vampire and hefts it onto his
            shoulder, charging up an elevated concrete embankment as --

<b>            INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            Nyssa and Asad find themselves cornered.  Their UV lasers are
            shot.  The Reapers are closing in and we're --


<b>            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL/CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
            Back with Blade, the Reapers overrunning him.  They pile atop
            one another in a frenzied effort to get to him.  Dozens and
            dozens of them.  And still Blade struggles upward, lifting
            the UV cluster bomb triumphantly above his head, triggering
            the device.

            The world goes white.

            No explosions.  Just BLINDING, PURIFYING LIGHT leaving us
            with a retina-burn image of Blade's silhouette surrounded by
            Reapers.  In that brief instant, the Reapers are frozen,
            revealed as WRAITH-LIKE X-RAY IMAGES of bone and muscle.

<b>            INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            A BLAST-WAVE of LIGHT fills the tunnel, chasing its way
            towards Nyssa and Asad, overtaking the Reapers before them.
            Asad throws himself at Nyssa, knocking her into the knee-deep
            water, shielding her body with his own.

<b>            BENEATH THE WATER
</b>
            Asad still burns, flaring up and disintegrating from the
            surface on downward like a piece of liquid-drenched
            magnesium, bubbles streaming from his writing body.

<b>            INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            Darkness, then patterns of subtle shadow and light as our
            vision slowly returns.  FWASH!  Blade strikes a FLARE.  In
            the sputtering aureole, the aftermath is slowly revealed.

            Blade crouches, unscathed, as if he were standing ground zero
            in the aftermath of Hiroshima.  Scores of Reaper ash-outlines
            radiate out from him, some of them flash-seared into the
            surrounding brickwork walls like permanent shadows.

<b>            INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</b>
            Blade slowly makes his way down the tunnel, using the
            sputtering flare to guide him.  As before, he sees nothing
            but Reaper ash outlines.  But then, Blade sees --

<b>            NYSSA
</b>
            Bleeding and horribly burned despite Asad's sacrifice.  Blade
            crouches, scooping her up into his arms.

<b>                                                                 CUT TO:

<b>            INT. HOSPITAL - INNER-CITY TRAUMA WARD - DAY

            BANG!  Blade kicks open a pair of doors, hurrying Nyssa
            inside.  He's carrying her limp form in his arms, having
            wrapped her in a blanket.  Blade himself looks like hell
            warmed over -- covered in blood, ash, and grime.

            He rushes her towards the ER, navigating through a maze of
            PATIENTS and VISITORS.  An ER NURSE approaches.

<b>                                ER NURSE
</b>                      Sir, you can't just --

            WHAM!  Blade shoulders the ER NURSE aside, barreling into the
            triage where bewildered DOCTORS and ORDERLIES wait.

<b>                                DOCTOR

</b>                      She needs a hypertransfusion.  NOW!

            Blade sets Nyssa down on an operating table, pulling off the
            blanket.  She's badly burned and she's lost an enormous
            amount of blood.  As we watch, she GROANS, revealing her
            fangs.

<b>                                DOCTOR

                      God in Heaven.

            Just then, a POLICEMAN enters, gun drawn.

<b>                                POLICEMAN
</b>                      Alright, buddy, step away if --

            WHAP!  Blade slaps the cop's gun away and KICKS him in the
            chest.  The cop flies backwards, SLAMS into a bank of
            equipment, falls.  A NURSE SCREAMS.  In a near blur, Blade
            has his MACH out and pressed against the Doctor's forehead.

<b>                                BLADE

                      Then get your fucking team in gear.

            Blade unsheathes his sword, deftly drawing the edge across
            his wrist, opening a vein.  He cradles Nyssa's head, pulling
            her mouth to the wound on his wrist.  And as she starts to
            feed we pull back and --

<b>            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - SHOWERS - DUSK

            Blade stands beneath the showerhead, turning his face up into
            the scalding spray, rinsing the blood from his chiseled
            physique.  Crimson water circles the drain.

<b>            INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - DUSK

            Nyssa now rests on a cot.  Peaceful, the color having
            somewhat returned to her features.  After a moment, her eyes
            flutter open and she takes in her surroundings.  She is in
            Blade's austere bedroom -- there are tatami mats, a basin for
            water, a well-thumbed volume of Zen koans.

<b>            A SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT

            cuts through an icy window pane above, angling down near
            Nyssa's cot.  Dust motes swirl about it.

            Nyssa focuses on it.  Longingly.  Then she raises her arm and
            reaches towards it.  Closer, closer -- just barely extending
            her hand into the light.  Her fingertips blacken and smoke,
            yet Nyssa endures the pain for another moment.  Finally, she
            withdraws her hand, inspecting the damage -- then notices
            Blade watching her from the doorway.

            She looks back to the sunlight, wistful, sits herself up.

                      predator?

            Nyssa pursues Blade, circling around in front of him so he
            has to face her again.

                      is that I made peace with who I was a

                      years.  You've been hunting yourself.

            Blade moves away.  She reaches for his shoulder.  He whirls
            on her, angry, traps her hand.  She tires to pull it free but
            he grips her wrist tightly, pulling her closer --

            And Blade kisses her, hungrily.  Nyssa responds in kind.  Her
            head drops low, her mouth finding the cords of his neck --
            sucking at his flesh, then sinking her teeth in deep and --

            WHAM!  Blade clamps a hand around her throat, slamming her
            head back.  A droplet of blood dribbles from her lips as she
            lets loose a breathless shudder.  She's in the ecstatic
            throes of the Thirst now, all reason gone.

            Blade reaches his other hand to her shirt, ripping it open as
            he runs his fingers across her breasts, then over her exposed
            rib cage.  He turns her around, forcing her against the wall,
            sinking his own fangs into the back of her neck.  She groans

<b>            THE TWO OF THEM

            Naked on the tatami mats upon which Blade sleeps.  Skin
            beaded with sweat.  Breath steaming in the chill air.  He's
            atop her, moving inside her with measured thrusts.

            Nyssa's limbs are wrapped around him.  She claws at the
            expanse of his back with her fingernails.  Her mouth is
            locked on Blade's throat, then his is locked on hers.
            Together they drink, leeching blood from one another.

<b>            PULLING BACK AGAIN
</b>
            Nyssa clutching greedily at Blade like she never wants to let
            go.  Her soul is gone -- transported to that place we drift
            to when the euphoria overtake us and we're somehow able to
            transcend the horror of our fleeting lives.

            Finally, Nyssa GASPS, climaxing as she retracts her fangs
            from Blade.  Her head rolls to the side as her pupil --
            focused on nothing short of eternity -- dilate unnaturally
            large.

            Blade and Nyssa lie in each other's arms, awash in moonlight,
            blissfully dead to the world until --

            He sits up, listening.  Nyssa stirs beside him.  She moves to
            speak but Blade holds up a hand, silencing her.  Together,

            Blade is at the computer workstation.  He activates the

            Blade spins, his MACH pistol up and ready to fire.  Whistler
            sits on the opposite side of the room, watching them as he
            smokes.

            Whistler gives Nyssa a rueful stare, then tosses Blade a

            Carter Stevens shuts down his computer workstation, then
            moves to the heavy oak door, glancing at a medical chart as

            Stands in the entry way.  Whistler is behind him, holding a

            Blade spins Stevens around, shoving his face against a glass
            case, crushing the man's nose, spiderwebbing the glass.

            Blade clamps his fingers around Stevens' broken nose and
            twists it with a sickening CRUNCH.  Stevens SCREAMS, caving.

                      Something went wrong.  The Reaper strain
                      was too aggressive.  Then Nomak escaped.

                      then these are your offspring.

            Damaskinos reaches to a nearby control panel, pressing a
            button.  A pair of massive doors slide apart, revealing:

<b>            THE EUGENICS CHAMBER
</b>
            We are in a vast, multitiered, temperature-controlled chamber
            -- equal parts 21st century medical facility and Hammer House
            of Horror.

            A network of catwalks look down upon the circular chamber,
            the center of which is dominated by a massive, steel cask,
            which is in turn ringed by a safety railing.  The operation
            looks not unlike a small-scale water purification plant, or
            perhaps a futuristic distillery.  Only in this instance, the
            liquid churning within the cask is HUMAN BLOOD.

<b>            TINY EMBRYOS
</b>
            Each no bigger than a thumbnail, line the walls of the
            chamber, preserved in credit card sized cryo-cases.  There
            are thousands of them, resting atop one another in racks with
            stretch from the floor on upwards.

            As Damaskinos removes an embryo from the rack, we see ANOTHER
            EMBRYO behind it.  That cryo-case now slides forward with a
            WHIR, taking the place of the one which Damaskinos removed.
            Like some kind of perverse vending machine.  God knows how
            deep they're stacked.  If thousands are visible, there could
            be tens of thousands in total.

            Damaskinos holds the translucent cryo-case up to the light.
            The Embryo within shudders, its tiny heart beating.

            BOOM!  We hear the tread of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS approaching.  All
            eyes turn towards a side corridor.

            enters from the shadows, holding Scud's rail-gun.  Much of

            SHOT even as Reinhardt FIRES.  BA-BANG!  Blade is hit in the
            side, spun clear around.  His shot goes wild, hitting one of
            the Guards in the head, turning him to ash as Blade himself
            falls to the floor.

            Blade GASPS in shock.  The rail-gun needles have ripped a
            brutal hole through the side of his chest-plate.  He clutches
            at his flank, trying to staunch the blood that's seeping
            between his fingers.  As he sits forward, we see MORE
            FLECHETTES have embedded in the wall behind him, having torn
            completely through him.

            Whistler steps forward.  One of the vampire sentries LASHES
            OUT, striking him in the face with the butt of his rifle.
            Whistler sinks to his knees, stunned.  The guard disarms him.

            Gritting his teeth against the pain.  He reaches inside his
            combat harness, pulling out the remote detonator for the
            explosive flechette in Reinhardt's skull.

<b>                                BLADE

                      flechette's a dud.

            Scud crosses over to Reinhardt's side.  Whistler stares at
            him in disbelief.

<b>                                SCUD (CONT'D)
</b>                      It was never supposed to explode.  All
                      it was supposed to do was make you feel
                      like you were in control.

            Blade's eyes darken with hatred.  Reinhardt laughs.

<b>                                REINHARDT
</b>                      Thought you had me on a short leash,
                      didn't you, chief?  Only it turns out,
                      you're the one that's been on the leash.

            Reinhardt digs his claws into his scalp and tugs the barbed
            flechette from his skull.  As he does so, Blade's remote
            detonator BEEPS to indicate it's being tempered with.
            Reinhardt finishes removing it and sighs contentedly.

</b>                      That's better.

            Reinhardt tosses the fletchette to Scud, who grins, flipping
            down his lower lip to reveal a vampire glyph tattooed on it.

            Blade looks to Nyssa who averts her gaze.

                      hair, anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson
                      look-a-like?

            Scud punches Whistler in the face.

</b>                      Man, I so wanted to do that.

            Scud shakes his hand, which is smarting from the blow.  He
            looks to Blade now, angry.

<b>                                SCUD (CONT'D)
</b>                      And you.  You never cared about me.  I
                      gave you everything.  All you cared
                      about was digging up the old fuck!  You
                      think they scoped out my security
                      system?
                          (chuckling)
                      I let them in.  Dude, I practically gave
                      'em the fucking keys.  I've been feeding
                      Damaskinos information the whole time.
                      Providing them with samples of your
                      genetic material -- helping them with
                      the Reaper program.  They're close,
                      Blade.  Right up against it.  Any day
                      now, they're all going to be Daywalkers.
                      And when that happens, well, let's just
                      say, I don't want to be on the losing
                      team.  You may be strong, you may be
                      fast, but in the end, you're just too
                      human, B.

            He pinches Blade's cheek.  Then he stands up.

</b>                      So that's down and dirty.  Got anything
                      to say for yourself?

                      Two things.  One, I was on to you the
                      moment they turned you.  And two --
                          (raising the detonator;
                           smiling)
                      I switched that dud of yours back with
                      the real one.

            Scud has a split-second of terrified, wide-eyed realization
            before Blade pushes the button and BOOM!  The flechette in
            Scud's hand EXPLODES, blowing his body apart, spraying those
            nearest him with blood.  Primarily Reinhardt.

            As the others react with varying degrees of surprise and
            horror, Reinhardt savagely KICKS Blade across the face.  He
            HITS Blade again and again, driving him down to the floor.
            Then he bends and tugs the sword from Blade's back-scabbard,
            preparing to cut his throat.

            Reinhardt hesitates.  Nyssa takes a step towards Blade, but
            Damaskinos stops her.  Damaskinos gestures to his guards.
            They haul Blade up and drag him from the lab.  Reinhardt
            gestures to Whistler.

<b>                                REINHARDT

                      Me and Hobo Kelly here have a little
                      unfinished business.

            Damaskinos waves dismissively.  Reinhardt takes Whistler
            away.

            Blade is dragged into a large autopsy room.  The vampire
            guards lay him on a steel autopsy table.  He struggles
            against them, but he's just too weak from loss of blood.
            Eventually they get him secured, clamping his wrists and
            ankles into steel manacles which are affixed to the table.

            PULL BACK to reveal Reinhardt holding Blade's sword.  He
            gives it a few practiced swings, then runs his thumb along
            the blade.

            Nyssa hears the ALARMS and moves into a corridor lit by red,
            strobing emergency lights.  VAMPIRE GUARDS are rushing past.

<b>            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

            Reinhardt also hears the ALARMS.  He looks to the
            surveillance monitors where he SEES Nomak.

<b>                                REINHARDT

            Behind him, we see Whistler taking advantage of the
            distraction.  He folds his legs up under him, working his
            cuffed hands over his feet.  When Reinhardt spins back away
            from the security monitors --

            Whistler is GONE.  A steel grating in the floor lies half
            open.  The obvious means of exit.

            As Nomak continues tearing down the autopsy door, BULLETS
            hammer into his back.  He turns, sees a DOZEN GUARDS FIRING
            at him, their gunfire chewing the shit out of the concrete
            walls around him.  Nomak staggers, but doesn't go down as
            CLEAR BLOOD sprays from the body hits.

            Whistler shuffles forward through the narrow conduit on his

            above, we glimpse TWO FIGURES rushing past --

</b>
            Damaskinos and Stevens round a corner, spilling into several
            GUARDS.  He shoves his fellow vampires aside.

            CLOSE ON a grate moving up from the floor.  Whistler emerges,

            Blade from his bonds, he looks to the ravaged door --

<b>            WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH THE V-SHAPED GAP IN DOOR)

            Nomak savages the guards, flinging them into the air.  A

            as --

            Whistler redoubles his efforts, finally freeing Blade.  He
            helps him from the autopsy table.  Blade is sinking, starting
            to fade.  Whistler slaps his face, shaking him.

            Carnage.  A frazetta painting come to life.  Nomak atop dead
            guards, draining the last of his victims' blood.  He whips
            his face in our direction and ROARS, charging the door --

<b>            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
            WHAM!  The door gives way and Nomak enters.  To the right, he
            SEES Whistler and Blade exiting.  To the left, he SEES the
            security monitors.  Damaskinos and Stevens can be glimpsed in
            one of these monitors.

            Nomak moves to the left.

<b>            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - THIRD CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
            Blade clutches his bleeding side, staggering down the
            corridor towards a door marked "Eugenics" with Whistler's
            help.  By all rights, Blade should be dead.  But he continues
            on, moving towards the door with determination.

            CLOSE ON a hand twisting a safety lever on the floor.  PULL
            BACK to reveal Stevens manually activating a series of
            hydraulic lock-down latches.

            CHINK!CHINK!CHINK!  The doors of the Eastern, Northern, and
            Western corridors are sealing, lock-down latches clamping
            down for extra security.  Even as the Western door seals, we
            glimpse Nomak rushing towards it with inhuman speed.

<b>            ON STEVENS
</b>
            panicked, turning towards the open elevator cab where --

<b>            DAMASKINOS
</b>
            is waiting.  But even as Stevens starts towards the elevator,
            Damaskinos dispassionately presses the "CLOSE DOOR" button.

<b>                                STEVENS

            Stevens rushes towards the closing elevator doors, but it's
            too late.  He pounds his fist against them.  Behind him, we
            hear a terrible RENDING OF METAL as the Western door gives.
            Stevens looks in that direction --

            In an eyeblink, Nomak is upon him, SLAMMING his hand over
            Stevens' face, crushing it.

<b>            INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - ELEVATOR CAB - NIGHT

            As Damaskinos slides a security card through a reader and
            punches in a code, a thin SPRAY OF BLOOD jets across his pale
            forearm.  He looks to the elevator doors.  The spray of blood
            is coming through the vertical door seal.  The metal doors
            SHUDDER violently and then the cab begins to ascend.
            Damaskinos retreats to the far corner of the elevator,
            breathing a sigh of relief.

            WHOOSH!  A pneumatic door slides open.  Blade and Whistler
            enter.  They are on the second level now, up amongst the
            catwalks.  Below them is the churning cask of purified blood.
            They have almost reached the end of the catwalk when --

<b>            REINHARDT AND HIS MEN
</b>
            converge on the lab from two directions at once.  Some of the
            vampires spill through the door on the second level with
            Reinhardt, while others enter on the ground floor.

<b>                                REINHARDT

            As Reinhardt takes aim at Blade with the shotgun, the other
            vampires FIRE.  Whistler is HIT in the leg.  He goes down,
            CRYING OUT, then grips Blade's arm, shoving him onward --

            gripping the guard rail for support, dragging himself along.
            Reinhardt fires.  A SHOTGUN BLAST hits Blade, grazing him but
            otherwise missing him.  As Reinhardt curses and prepares to
            fire again --

            Blade makes it to the end of the catwalk, pitching himself
            out into open space.  Time slows to a crawl as Blade tumbles
            downward, plummeting into --

<b>            THE BLOOD CASK BELOW
</b>
            Blade sinks from view, disappearing beneath the churning
            slurry of crimson.  A beat passes as Reinhardt and his men
            draw closer, apprehensive.  Then, an explosion of BLOOD
            gushes over Reinhardt and the others.  They fall backwards,
            blinded, slipping --

<b>            BLADE
</b>
            surfaces from the cask in morbidly glorious slow-motion.
            Think of Sheen in the end-sequence of Apocalypse Now, only
            instead of a river of mud, Blade is covered head-to-toe in
            crimson.  Majestic and glistening.  A primordial god.  He
            rears back his head, letting loose a triumphal ROAR.

            Reinhardt's men hesitate.  One look at Blade's eyes and we
            can see he's tapped into a well-spring of fury even he never
            knew he had.  The man is super-charged and ready for war.

            Blade tears into the vampires, unleashing a blizzard of
            martial arts moves.  He powers a right hook into the first
            vampire's face, then pivots, launching a devastating spinning
            back-fist into the face of a second.  At the same time, he
            rips the second guard's security belt from his waist,
            twirling it around nanchadku-style to blind a third guard and
            capture the wrist of a fourth.

            Some vampires FIRE their guns, but Blade is a whirlwind,
            shifting and dodging.  BULLETS go wild, hitting circuitry,
            EXPLODING APART cannisters of combustible chemicals.  In
            seconds, FLAMES are licking across the laboratory floor.

            Blade drops, causing a pair of vampires to FIRE their guns at
            one another.

            Then Blade knocks two more vampires onto their asses with a
            foot sweep.  Then he's up again.  Slamming the bridge of a
            fifth vampire's nose into his brain with a palm heel strike.

            A snap kick, an overhand elbow strike, a knee stamp that
            shatter's the vampire's knee cap.  An upward block, a jab, a
            cross, a shin kick aimed at a vamp's quadriceps.

            Overhand punches, rising punches, parallel punches, spinning
            rear elbows, deep kicks, on and on and on and on in an orgy
            of super-hero violence until --

            WHAM!  Blade cuts the last of the vampire soldiers down,
            turning from the creature's disintegrating body to face --

<b>            REINHARDT
</b>
            The vampire mercenary clutches Blade's sword in his hand, but
            the weapon provides him with little sense of security given
            that he's just seen a dozen of his men slaughtered.  The
            automatic sprinkler system is on now, spraying water down
            upon Blade and Reinhardt alike.  Blade advances.

            Reinhardt's been cornered.  There's nowhere else for him to
            run.  Refusing to be cowed, Reinhardt SCREAMS and brings the
            sword down at Blade's head when WHOOSH --

            But Blade swings his hands upward, slapping them on either
            side of the blade, trapping the sword on its downward arc.

            Reinhardt strains, trying to tear the sword away from Blade's
            grip.  The vampire's eyes widen in fear.  And during that
            split-second in which the two men are frozen, connected by
            the weapon which vibrates between them, Blade says:

<b>                                BLADE

                      blush?

            TWHISH!  The sword twists free from Reinhardt's grasp,
            spinning upward into the air.  Reinhardt stumbles backwards
            against the blood cask railing as --

            Blade catches the sword on its way down, swinging it around
            in one fluid motion, slicing Reinhardt's torso in half, along
            with a diagonal axis!  Reinhardt sinks to his knees as the
            TWO HALVES split apart, turning to ash before they hit floor.

            Beat.  Blade stands beneath the spray of the overhead
            sprinklers, rinsing the blood from his body.  He turns
            towards the exit, sword in hand.

            A set of elevator doors open, disgorging Damaskinos.  Beyond
            the lobby windows we can SEE a waiting helicopter, VAMPIRE
            SOLDIERS readying it for take-off.  Damaskinos rushes across
            the lobby and is almost at the exit when --

            CHUNK!CHUNK!CHUNK! A series of steel shutters slam down over
            the doors and windows.  Damaskinos tries to tug one of the
            shutters upwards, then moves to a keypad nearby.  He starts
            hurriedly tapping in a numeric sequence when we hear:

<b>                                NYSSA (O.S.)
</b>                      I overrode the security codes.

            Damaskinos spins around.  Nyssa stands behind him.  She's got
            Whistler's rail-gun in her hands.

<b>                                NYSSA (CONT'D)

            AS if in response, a GRINDING SHUDDER comes from the elevator
            doors.  Damaskinos spins in wide-eyed horror, then --

            Damaskinos turns back to his daughter, making a last appeal.

                      here!

            WHAM!WHAM!WHAM!  Nomak pounds away.  The elevator doors are
            starting to buckle, then they tear apart completely --

<b>            NOMAK
</b>
            bursts into the lobby, ROARING.  If anything, he is even more
            animalistic now, his features having become grossly
            distorted.

<b>                                NOMAK

                      Why are you frightened, father?  The
                      prodigal son has returned.

            Damaskinos scurries backwards, but there's nowhere left to
            run.  Nomak descends on him, lifting the vampire into a rib
            crushing embrace, chomping his elongated canines into
            Damaskinos' throat.

            Damaskinos SQUEALS like a child as his life-blood is sucked
            out of him.  His body begins to cave inward, shrinking and
            twisting until there's nothing left but shriveled husk.

            Nyssa hefts the rail-gun and FIRES at Nomak's back.  Nomak
            HOWLS, releasing Damaskinos' body, then turns, focusing his
            blood-drunk gaze on Nomak.

            But Nyssa stands her ground, rachetting back the slide on the
            rail-gun, readying to unleash another barrage of needles.
            Nomak CHARGES, moving at unbelievable speed.  She FIRES
            AGAIN, aiming at Nomak's chest --

            but then Nomak is upon her.  He slaps the rail-gun from her
            hands, SMASHING IT TO PIECES.
            Then he wraps his hand around her throat, pulling her
            forward, sinking his teeth into her neck.  Nyssa SCREAMS.

<b>            ON BLADE

            as he leaps from the mezzanine level, sword extended, like
            Beowulf diving to slay Grendel.  He PLUNGES the sword deep
            into Nomak's upper torso.  Then DRIVES it in even further --

            Nomak releases Nyssa and back-hands Blade across the face,
            sending him sailing through the air.  He lands, skids across
            the floor --

<b>            ON NOMAK
</b>
            stumbling backwards into the wall.  The sword has sunk so
            deep that the tip is actually protruding out his back,
            SCRAPING a gash across the wall as Nomak slides towards the
            floor.

            Nomak GRUNTS, then reaches for the pomeel with his ruined
            hand.  He grips the pommel and SNAPS the sword-blade in half.
            Then he SLAMS against the wall, forcing the half of the
            broken blade that's still embedded in him out back through
            the front of his chest.  As Nomak rises to his feet --

            Blade is on him again, snap-kicking the Reaper in the chest.
            Nomak retaliates.  Blade somersaults out of the way, then
            springs back again, KICKING Nomak in the face, BREAKING
            Nomak's NECK.  Nomak's head lolls unnaturally sideways for a
            heartbeat and then Nomak swings his head around, somehow
            righting his neck vertebrae with a snap of his head.

            They trade blows, a brutal death-match that seems to defy
            gravity.  Blade moves in for a round-house punch, but Nomak
            catches his fist, holding it for a split-second, then bending
            Blade's hand at an unnatural angle, SNAPPING his wrist bones.
            The pain is enormous.

            Nomak starts beating the living shit out of Blade, pummeling
            him with his fists, gripped by an uncontrollable rage.  He
            SMASHES Blade against a marble column, cracking it.  Then he
            flings Blade against one of the brushed steel walls - so hard
            that Blade's body actually leaves an indentation.

            Before Blade can recover, Nomak is in front of him, launching
            another kick.  Blade rolls his head out of the way, barely
            avoiding Nomak's boot heel which dents the wall.  Nomak kicks
            a second time.  Blade avoids Nomak, but third time's the
            charm and Nomak lands one squarely in Blade's gut.
            Blade falls beneath a flurry of blows, unable to defend
            himself any longer.  Blood stains his eyes, obscuring his
            vision.  He strikes out blindly, but Nomak has forced him to
            the ground, pinning him there.  As Blade struggles to free
            himself --

<b>            NOMAK
</b>
            lowers his head towards Blade's face.  The scar/seam in
            Nomak's chin splits open and Nomak's lower jaw flares apart,
            distending and widening to reveal the awful, glistening hell
            maw -- the hollow inner fangs and striated cartilage which
            are closing about Blade's face.  Blade twists his head
            violently to the right, then glimpses the broken tip of his
            sword resting a few feet away.  He reaches for it in
            desperation, plunging it up into Nomak's chest.  Nomak HOWLS.
            Because the hilt has been broken off, Blade is forced to grip
            the cutting edge of the weapon with his bare hands.  It
            slices into his fingers --

            but Blade just grips the broken sword tighter, ignoring the
            pain, driving it deeper and deeper -- until, suddenly, it
            penetrates the cartilaginous shell around Nomak's heart and --

<b>                                NOMAK
</b>                          (in vampire dialect)
                      Blood brother.

            Nomak smiles, covering Blade's hands with his own.  He looks
            blade in the eye, then drives the broken sword home.

            Nomak's body stiffens, his eyes grow unseeing, an oddly
            serene look spreading across his tortured face.  A patch of
            BLACKNESS begins radiating outward from his chest, moving
            over his body, carbonizing him from within.  As his blackened
            flesh begins to crack, BLUE FLAMES flicker out from the
            fissures.  In seconds, Nomak is gone.

            Beat.  Blade stands, exhausted.  Then he looks to where Nyssa
            rests.  He moves to her side, kneeling beside her.  She
            smiles up at him, bravely, but frightened all the same.
            Blade inspects the wound on her neck.  It's clearly fatal.

<b>                                NYSSA
</b>                      How does it look?

<b>                                BLADE
</b>                          (with genuine sadness)
                      Not good.

            Nyssa nods.  Blade has only confirmed her existing fears.

<b>                                NYSSA
</b>                      It won't be long now.  I can already
                      feel it burning inside me --

            She grips Blade's arm, her eyes welling with tears.

<b>                                NYSSA (CONT'D)
</b>                      I don't want to become what Nomak was --
                          (beat; straining)
                      I can't.  I want to die while I'm still
                      vampire.

            Blade sighs.  The burden is all to familiar to him.

<b>                                BLADE
</b>                      What do you want me to do?

<b>                                NYSSA
</b>                      I want to see the sun rise.

<b>            ON BLADE
</b>
            his face a mask of sad resignation.  He lifts Nyssa into his
            arms.  She closes her eyes, resting her head on his chest.

<b>            EXT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - JUST BEFORE DAWN
</b>
            The shutters over the doors and windows slowly rise.  Blade
            shoulders open the front door, moving across the lawn towards
            a bluff overlooking the ocean.  A moment later, Whistler
            emerges into the light, watching as Blade sets Nysa down on
            the grass.  Her eyes flutter open and she looks into --

<b>            THE HORIZON
</b>
            where the faintest glimmer of pre-dawn light brightens the
            cloud-swept sky.  It's peaceful.  We can hear the SURF
            crashing on the shore below.

            Together they wait.

            A GLIMMER OF LIGHT emerges over the earth's curvature,
            spreading its dazzling radiance out across the skyline.
            Nyssa's eyes widen in expectation, her breath catching.  She
            looks up at Blade, stroking his face, smiling.

<b>                                NYSSA
</b>                      Each day is a little life.  Remember?

            Blade nods, he's strong for her.  Despite his best efforts, a
            tear slides down his cheek.  They kiss then as the sun rises
            in full glory, flooding the world with its brilliance.

            Blade holds Nyssa tightly to his chest, refusing to
            relinquish his grip as her body catches fire.  The end is
            blessedly quick -- not a slow-burn of blazing agony, but a
            nearly seamless transition from life --

            To ash...  Nyssa collapses apart in Blade's arms, billowing
            out around him in a cloud of glowing embers.  One moment
            she's there, the next she's gone.  Blade remains where he is,
            kneeling on the bluff, the wind carrying the last traces of
            Nyssa aloft into the sky.  He shuts his eyes.  Turns his face
            to the warmth of the sun, surrendering himself to acceptance.

<b>            WE RISE UP
</b>
            isolating Blade alone on the windswept bluff.  After a
            moment, Whistler moves to Blade's side.  He rests a hand on
            Blade's shoulder, but doesn't say a word.  We keep moving up
            and up until the two of them are just a pair of tiny figures
            on the rolling coastline.  Then we --

            Images of a weapon being forged, all filtered through
            shimmering convection waves of intense heat.  We SEE a HAMMER
            CLANGING DOWN.  The FIRES of a ROARING furnace.  SPARKS
            showering up from titanium slowly being given shape.  Molten
            silver.  Acid etching.  And then we PULL BACK to reveal --

<b>            INT. BLADE'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT
</b>
            Blade works before a forge by moonlight, his body dripping
            with sweat.  He slips his hand in a protective glove and
            grips the red-hot weapon, dousing it in a quench bucket.  As
            a cloud of steam envelops Blade, he lifts it up for view.

<b>            A NEW SWORD
</b>
            perfect.  Lethal.  Wrought from titanium, plated in sliver.
            As Blade inspects the sword, we hear his earlier words again:

<b>                                BLADE (V.O.)
</b>                      I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I
                      do.  It's in my blood...

            Satisfied with his work, Blade smiles --

<b>            INT. FUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

            Rush, the vampire brother wanna-be from the opening of the
            film, is up at the register, exchanging a twenty for a
            handful of tokens.  He's humming along to that old E-Rotic
            song "Voulez-vous couchez avec moi".

                      can never get enough --

            We FOLLOW HIM down a hall lined with video booths, serenaded
            all the while by the cheesy SYNTH SOUNDTRACKS and faked
            ORGASMOGROANS coming from beyond the doors.

            Rush stops at "Buddy Booth No. 3 - HOT ONE-ON-ONE ACTION."

<b>            INT. BUDDY BOOTH - NIGHT
</b>
            Rush steps inside.  There's a chair set in front of a
            Plexiglas window, an intercom with a phone receiver, box of
            Kleenex, and a slot for the tokens.

            Rush gets himself situated, picks up the receiver, then
            eagerly pops some tokens in the slot.

                      Voulez-vous coucher AVEC MOI!!!

            With a HUM, the screen in front of the window rises, offering
            us a view of the booth on the other side of the Plexiglas.
            Only instead of a skanked out booth girl, Rush finds himself
            staring in open-mouthed astonishment at --

            In a near blur, Blade draws his new sword from his back
