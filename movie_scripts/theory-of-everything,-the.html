          TWO BESPECTACLED EYES. Blinking. Alert. Male. Middle-aged.
          Reflected in his shiny GLASSES - a WOMAN, middle-aged, (JANE
          HAWKING) removing the glasses from his nose.

          The MAN's POV, as -

          removed.
                         
          - his BLURRY POV of the WOMAN's hands POLISHING his glasses
          with a cloth.
                         
          - his BLURRY POV then shifts (as she steps aside) onto a
          SMALL PERSON in the distance jumping up and down.
                         
          - his BLURRY POV of the GLASSES then being replaced on his
          nose, and -
                         
          - with this, his VISION comes abruptly into FOCUS, and the
          SMALL PERSON is revealed to be -- a BOY (10) playing
          HOPSCOTCH in the RED-CARPETED CORRIDOR.
                         
          - Beyond the BOY, TWO RED-COATED EQUERRIES begin
          (unceremoniously) to prepare the HALLWAY for a ceremony. They
          lay out potted-plants and drape velvet ropes. One blows his
          nose.
                         
          TIGHT ON: The eyes behind the glasses watching, his eyes
          finally looking downward...as we hear a metallic CLICKING
          sound - "CLICK, CLICK, CLICK..."
                         
          - ANGLE ON: HIS HAND, which is clicking a CLICKER-PLATE...
                         
          - then on a COMPUTER MONITOR (mounted to the CHAIR), words
          form out of a streaming alphabet with each 'CLICK'. The man
          is at work, selecting LETTERS, then WHOLE WORDS from a MENU
          ...making sentences by these means.
                         
          - OTHER PARTIAL VIEWS (ECUs) of this MAN in his WHEELCHAIR.
                         
          We see...a TUFT of BROWN HAIR...his HAND on chair arm-rest
          ...his FEET on a wheelchair's foot-rests...JANE's HANDS

          we see the full man, as -
                         
          - the TWO EQUERRIES open TWO LARGE ORNATE DOORS and motion
          the PARTY forward.

          (same age), race each other recklessly through the NARROW,
          WINDING LANES. It looks VERY DANGEROUS. They are neck and
          neck. And they are loving it.
                         
          STEPHEN HAWKING, his face almost entirely covered with
          spectacles and floppy hair, slight of frame, a velvet jacket
          and velvet bow tie, eccentric-looking. STEPHEN is a fun-
          loving, playful, active, young student.
                         
          BRIAN, STEPHEN's best friend. More interested in life than
          studies, as we shall see.

          settles down with a clean pad and a pencil. He looks at the

          at teeming university life, as he ponders.

          for another pad, but to no avail.

          walks, as best he can, off toward his BALL, using his MALLET
          as a WALKING STICK. With his second shot he hits her BALL. He

          touches, puts his foot on his ball, then smacks his BALL HARD
          with his MALLET, blasting her ball down to the next hoop.
                         
          He proceeds to play a MASTER GAME that will not allow JANE
          another shot, enlisting her ball to advance his own from HOOP

          The CHURCH in winter - a dusting of snow on everything. To
          the sound of ORGAN, SINGING CHOIR and CONGREGATION, the front
          doors open, and the VICAR appears to shake the hands of the
          first departing church-goers.

          The SERVICE is over. The congregation departs, revealing -
                         
          - JANE in her seat, still reading a prayer book, as -
                         
          - JONATHAN walks up the nave, toward her, chatting with the
          departing CHORISTERS. It seems that he hasn't noticed JANE
          and he passes close by, seemingly without seeing her. She
          averts her eyes.
                         
          Then suddenly she feels a HAND brush her shoulder. When she
          turns to look, JONATHAN has walked past, and is still avidly
          talking to the CHORISTERS, heading for the main doors.
                         
          JANE, with a beating heart, turns forward again and hears -
                         
          - the FRONT DOORS of the church close. She is alone. She
          starts to cry in the empty church - thinking she has lost him
          forever, but then --
                         
          -- she hears SOFT PIANO MUSIC. She turns. Yes, music is
          coming from above. She rises, and moves toward the sound.

          JANE slowly walks TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE PIANO, which slowly
          grows louder, louder, until -
                         
          - with a pounding heart, she discovers JONATHAN, at the
          piano, gently playing his beloved Bach. Only eventually does
          he raise his eyes and smile at her, a smile which expresses
          his hope that she would come to him. She smiles back, her
          heart ready to burst.

                    There ought to be something very
                    special about the boundary
                    conditions of the universe - and
                    what can be more special than that
                    there is no boundary? And there
                    should be no boundary to 
                    human endeavour. We are all
                    different. There is no such thing
                    as a standard or run of the mill
                    human being--but we share the same
                    human spirit. However bad life may
                    seem, there is always something you
                    can do, and succeed at. While
                    there's life, there is hope.

          JANE moves close to STEPHEN. They look at each other in the
