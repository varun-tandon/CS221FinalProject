          A MAN, standing waist-deep in the surf. White shirt, neck
          tie, hair perfectly parted. Wire framed glasses rest on the
          bridge of his nose. His name is ALEJANDRO.
                         
          He rises his face to the sun.
                         
<b>                               ALEJANDRO(V.O.)
</b>                     I think about the price. The price
                     of appetite. The cost of
                     forgetting who we are. Pretending
                     we are... who we will never be...
                         
          He looks young for 35, but his eyes -- seems they lived for
          decades before him. He closes them, bathing his face in
          sunshine.
                         
<b>                               ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
</b>                     So easy to pretend we are not to
                     blame. That a demon enters us.
                     No... The demon is inside. We just
                     make potions that release it.
                         
          The muscles of his neck tense.
                         
<b>                               ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
</b>                     There's no revenge for all they
                     have taken. No justice. It simply
                     is...
                         
                         
          His lip curls. His eyes open. He looks down.
                         
<b>                               ALEJANDRO (V.O.)
</b>                     And still. They must be forced to
                     look at all they have destroyed. By
                     having the same done to them. Or
                     they will forget... Forget they are
                     human. Believe they are as
                     different as they feel... Then they
                     are the lion, and everything we
                     loved and lost, simply its meal.
                         
          We hear SPLASHING and the panicked gasps of a man trying not
          to drown.
                         
          Only now do WE SEE: Alejandro is holding someone under the
          water.
                         
          He lets the drowning man catch a breath, barely. Pushes him
          back under. Looks out. Lost in thought.

          his belly, the sun high overhead.

          A VERTICAL LINE OF WHITE LIGHT invades us, then grows. The
          eye disappears in it's wake.

          TWO DOORS swing open. We see the silhouettes of TWELVE PEOPLE
          DRESSED FOR BATTLE, rifles at the ready, barrels pointing up.
          CAMERA is so close to the woman's face, it almost touches
          her. Her lips are moving, silently reciting...
                         
          We are in a SWAT ASSAULT VEHICLE. It is MOVING BACKWARDS fast
          and slams through a faded picket fence. Stops in the yard of
          a crumbling house.
                         
          They all rise and leap from the vehicle.

          WE ARE RIGHT BEHIND THE WOMAN, who mumbles the prayer as she
          runs. The back of her vest reads: FBI. Her name is KATE MACY.

          They reach the door, a shotgun BLASTS THE HINGES. It falls
          like a drawbridge.

          She speaks the prayer faster, desperate to finish before she
          has to kill anyone, or be killed herself.

          SWAT officers rush in, screaming.

          Two LATINO MEN, 20'S, are slammed to the ground. Another
          LATINO comes from nowhere, throwing himself on an AFRICAN
          AMERICAN MAN wearing an FBI vest. A taser is pressed to his
          neck and he falls, paralyzed, backward.
                         
          Macy takes in the chaos, then pushes farther into the house,
          running past a bedroom with an open door.
                         
          From the corner of her eye she sees:
                         
<b>          A MAN POINTING A SHOTGUN AT HER.
</b>                         
          She ducks as a SHOTGUN BLAST rips 10 inches of dry wall above
          her.
                         
          She turns, pressing the CAMERA against the wall. We watch
          over her shoulder as she returns fire.
                         
          A rooster tail of shell casings are thrown over us, invading
          our view. Bullet after bullet pound him. The man's knees
          give. He's falling...
                         
          A round hits him in the face and he is thrown back -- blood,
          brain, and skull fragments explode like shrapnel on the wall
          behind him.
                         
          Adrenaline hits her like a fever. She gets dizzy, sits
          against the wall, gasping for breath. A SWAT officer rushes
          to her.

          The SWAT officer looks at the hole in the drywall. Leans
          forward. Looks closer... What the fuck IS that??
                         
          His face now inches from the hole then jumps back like he was
          bitten by a snake.

          cellophane.
                         
          Macy stands up and turns around. Looks at it. Trying to
          process what she's seeing. She walks up and starts pulling at
          the drywall. Other officers join her. They yank and tear a
          six foot hole in the wall, then stand back, speechless.
                         
                         
          Bodies are standing side by side. A lime-green dust has
          spilled out on the floor.

          it down maybe ten seconds. Vomits... We see another SWAT
          OFFICER doing the same.
                         
          FBI AGENT REGGIE WAYNE, 30, African American, walks from the

          The boy pulls with all his might. Silvio makes a show of
          resisting, then climbs out of bed. Eliseo keeps a tight hold
          of his hand, and walks him down a hall to a small kitchen
          with adobe walls and a dirt floor. An opening leads to a
          small patio that now serves mostly as a chicken coop. Two
          chickens are in the kitchen.
                         
          A woman stands over a stove, cooking.

          She turns and smiles at her son, the bright star in her black
          life. Her eyes pass over Silvio. She stopped loving him years
          ago, but he adores their little boy... At least they have
          that.
                         
          He sits down. She scoops eggs onto a plate with tortillas,
          drops it in front of him. Hands him a coffee. He sniffs it,
          hands it back. Without a word she pours in two fingers of
          tequila.
                         
          The boy stares at his father with endless joy. No idea how
          unlucky he is.
                         
          Silvio stares back, winks. The boy smiles.

          Silvio and Eliseo exit the house. Silvio wears a State Police
          uniform, dressed to intimidate. The boy wears his uniform,
          dressed to play soccer. They walk past cinder-block houses,
          one after the other, cracked and faded from the sun.
                         
          Tejano music, car horns, and distant yelling penetrate the
          morning.
                         
          Two ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS drive past.
                         
          Silvio and Eliseo wander away, Eliseo's tiny hand clinging to
          Silvio's police belt. Eliseo has his father for the whole day
          and he isn't letting go.
                         
          They turn and disappear around the corner. Only thing on the
          street is a stray dog burying itself in an overturned trash
          can... The mascot of this dying city.

          while escaping to someplace else.
                         
          He lets the man up. Coughing, heaving up salt water, and

          Alejandro, looking back.
                         
          The man makes a half hearted attempt at attacking Alejandro,
          who pushes and spins him like a defiant child.
                         
          They walk a few steps and the man tries it again. Alejandro's
          appears only half committed to the sloppy assault. Alejandro
          slaps the man across the face, then pushes him forward,
          slapping the back of his head as he does.

          kidnapper and captive, lounging on the shore. He considers
          running. Considers fighting him again, but settles on resting

          face down in a hallway, naked. Blood pooled beneath her.
                         
          We hear a HEART BEAT. We move down a hall. Heart beating
          FASTER. Past a MEXICAN POLICE OFFICER, who somberly watches
          us... At the end of the hall we hear something rubbing,
          swaying. We move faster. Heart beats faster. Racing now.

          blocks and they all snake right. Macy is trying hard not to
          be terrified.
                         
          Suddenly, the convoy picks up speed. Moving 70mph over a road
          that barely qualifies as two lanes.
                         
          They race past a park. A large building can be seen on the
          right. The Mexican flag flies in front. Numerous Federal
          Police vehicles in front.
                         
          The convoy stops in front and the Delta operators are out of
          their vehicles, setting a perimeter. The Marshals and Matt
          emerge and move straight to the building, two Deltas follow.

          hands.
                         
          The delta operators and Alejandro are yelling at the men in
          Spanish. One retreats to the safety of the back seat, but the
          others know the consequences of a failed hit and they aren't
          in checkmate like those in the other cars...
                         
          The assassins, none over twenty years old, yell and cuss and
          threaten as the operators surround them in a semicircle.
                         
          The assassin that exited the drivers seat -- 2 carat diamond
          earrings and no shirt on his skinny chest -- screams in
          hateful defiance at the operators surrounding him.
                         
          He raises his weapon and ALEJANDRO AND THE OPERATORS FIRE --
          He is obliterated -- They continue firing, surgically killing
          all the Expedition's crew. Bullets ping through the
          windshield. Bullets tear the Expedition to shreds. The
          assassins never fire a shot.
                         
          The innocent masses stuck in the crossfire duck out of view
          in their vehicles. The streets are instantly empty.
                         
          The noise of the shooting echoes off the asphalt with the
          force of thunder.
                         
          Macy watches through the back window.

          vehicle. Everyone retreats to their cars.
                         
          The kid with the AK 47 in the back of the Buick makes a move
          for his door handle. Alejandro clocks it, puts 10 rounds
          through the window, killing him and the man beside him before
          the door is opened.

          Before she can think, her gun is raised and firing through
          the tinted window.
                         
          The sound is deafening. As the man falls out of view, all we
          can hear is the RINGING IN HER EARS.
                         
          Alejandro and the agent riding shotgun jump in and roll their
          windows down and sit out of them like turrets as the vehicles
          start up and race to the border.
                         
          They pass the guard house without stopping, Border Agents
          waving them onward through the finish line. More agents point
          weapons and scream at the Mexican State police officers who
          have emerged from their offices.

          Alejandro opens the back door before letting Manuel get in
          the front. In an instant, Manuel is in the driver's seat and
          Alejandro seated behind. The doors are closed and the Range
          Rover disappears down the road. We are left with Silvio,
          gasping, struggling, like a fish tossed thoughtlessly on the
          beach, as he flops helplessly on the empty road.

          private road that leads a mile or so onto Fausto's hacienda.
                         
          As the large house comes into view. VEHICLES can be seen

          Dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, she sits on the balcony,
          takes a drag of her cigarette. Looks at it.

          comes up with her pistol. He moves so fast there is no time

          disassembles the slide, and tosses the pieces on the table.

          He begins lifting her shirt. She struggles and he grabs her
          throat. She looks into his eyes and it is a killer looking
          back.

          shirt above her bare breasts. Six large, red welts...

          He drops her shirt and steps back. She crosses her arms,
          feeling very weak.

          reassembling the pistol. Rams the magazine in and racks a

          Playing. Being children. The referee blows a whistle. The
