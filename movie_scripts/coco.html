      A path of marigold petals leads up to an altar lovingly
      arranged in a humble cemetery. An old woman lights a candle
      as the smoke of burning copal wood dances lyrically upward...

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  Sometimes I think I'm cursed...
                  'cause of something that happened
                  before I was even born.

      A story begins to play out on the papel picado.

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  See, a long time ago there was this
                  family.

      The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a
      father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy.

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  The papá, he was a musician.

      The papá plays guitar while the mother dances with her
      daughter.

<b>                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  He and his family would sing, and
                  dance, and count their blessings...
                      (beat)
                  But he also had a dream... to play
                  for the world.
                      (beat)
                  And one day he left with his
                  guitar... and never returned.

      The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In
      another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching
      her papá leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her
      mamá, hardened.

      She shuts the door.

<b>                             MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  And the mamá...? She didn't have
                  time to cry over that walkaway
                  musician!

                  life...

      The woman gets rid of all of her husband's instruments and
      records.

<b>                             MIGUEL (V.O.)

                  She rolled up her sleeves and she
                  learned to make shoes.
                      (beat)
                  She could have made candy!

      Amongst the papel picado, a stick swings at a strung up
      piñata which bursts with candy...

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers!

      Sparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst
      other linens...

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  But no... she chose shoes...

      On the papel picado, the little girl becomes a young woman.

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  Then she taught her daughter to
                  make shoes. And later, she taught
                  her son-in-law.

      She introduces a suitor to the family business.

<b>                            MIGUEL (V.O.)
</b>                  Then her grandkids got roped in.
                  As her family grew, so did the
                  business.

      In the next vignette, a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in
      the shoemaking. The shoe shop is full of family!

                  but shoes held them all together.
                      (beat)
                  You see, that woman was my great-
                  great grandmother, Mamá Imelda.

      TILT DOWN from the papel picado to the


<b>      OFRENDA ROOM - DAY

      where a photo sits at the top of a beautiful altar. The
      photo features MAMÁ IMELDA -- serious, formidable. She holds
      a baby on her lap. Her husband stands beside her, but his
      face has been torn away.

                  But my family still tells her story
                  every year on Día de los Muertos --

                      (beat)
                  And her little girl?

      Fade from the face of the little girl to present day MAMÁ

                  Coco has trouble remembering
                  things... But it's good to talk to

      He passes a band of musicians playing a tune. Miguel joins
      with some air guitar and the further down the street he goes,
      the more instruments and sounds layer in. The bells of the
      church chime in harmony, a radio blares a cumbia rhythm.

      As Miguel passes all these scenes, the music synthesizes and
      he can't help but tap out rhythms along a table of alebrijes.
      The fantastical wooden animal sculptures each play a
      different tone like a marimba. Miguel finishes with a SMACK
      on a trash can, out of which a pops up a scrappy hairless
      Xolo dog. The dog, DANTE, barks and jumps up to lick Miguel,
      who laughs.

                  the things they loved in life,

      Tío Berto unloads rolls of leather from a truckbed. Nearby,
      Dante sleeps under the shade of a tree. He startles awake by
      a faint TWANGING. The dog scrambles up to the roof.

      He reaches a shoe sign advertising the Rivera Family business
      and lifts it up.


<b>      INT. ROOFTOP HIDEOUT

      Dante pokes his head in.      Miguel turns and gasps.

                  Dante. Hurry up.

      Dante wriggles into the hideout. Miguel is huddled over
      something. The dog peeks around his shoulder.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)

                  boy. Someone could hear me!

      Miguel reveals a makeshift guitar, cobbled together from a
      beat up old soundboard and random other items.

      He takes a china marker and sketches a nose on what appears
      to be his own version of a skull guitar head.

<b>                            MIGUEL (CONT'D)

</b>                  Other than you...

      Dante gives Miguel a big sloppy lick. Miguel gives a grossed-
      out chuckle. He lifts his guitar and strums.

<b>                              MIGUEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  Perfecto!

      He crawls to the far side of the attic where he's built his
      own ofrenda to Ernesto de la Cruz. Posters, candles, and
      songbooks are arranged with care. Miguel lights the candles
      with reverence, illuminating an album cover of de la Cruz
      holding his skull guitar.

      Miguel compares the head of his guitar to the album cover.
      Then he imitates de la Cruz's pose and smile.

      He switches on a beat up old TV and pushes a tape into the
      VCR, "Best of de la Cruz" scrawled on the spine.

      A montage of the greatest moments from de la Cruz's films
      plays out.

      A clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"

      Miguel strums his guitar as de la Cruz imparts his wisdom.
      More clips run in the background as Miguel plays:

<b>                            DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP)
</b>                  When life gets me down, I play my

      De la Cruz kisses a woman passionately.      Miguel cringes.

      Another clip from "A QUIEN YO AMO:"

      As Miguel watches de la Cruz play guitar in the video, he
      repeats the melody on his own guitar.

      Miguel's tune intertwines with the melodies on the TV set.
      The clip jumps forward:

      The tape ends. The words sink into Miguel.        He reaches for
      the flyer for the plaza "TALENT SHOW."

      In the courtyard, two TODDLER COUSINS haphazardly scatter
      marigold petals from their baskets.

<b>                            MAMÁ
</b>                  No, no, no, no, no.

      Mamá corrects them, creating a path from the ofrenda room to
      the front gate.

<b>                            MAMÁ (CONT'D)

                  the ofrenda, sí?

      As Mamá teaches, Miguel and Dante sneak across the roof and
      drop to the sidewalk outside the compound, Miguel clutching
      his guitar.

      Suddenly Tío Berto and Papá round the corner carrying a small
      table from storage.

      Miguel and Dante back up to avoid the adults, only to find
      Abuelita sweeping the sidewalk behind them! Miguel and Dante
      jump into the back into the Rivera courtyard before she sees
      them.

      Miguel backs out of the courtyard and into the family ofrenda

      Papá heads out of the room, Mamá follows. Last is Abuelita,
      who smothers Miguel with tons of kisses as she leaves.

      With the family gone, Miguel deflates.

      Suddenly, a noise comes from the ofrenda. Miguel turns to
      find Dante on the bottom tier, licking a plate of mole to his
      heart's content. Miguel is horrified!

      Miguel pulls the dog away from the ofrenda, but the table
      shakes. The frame with Mamá Imelda's photo sways back and
      forth, then topples to the ground with a sickening crack.

      No answer. Miguel's gaze falls on a plaque at the base of
      the statue that reads "Seize Your Moment!" Miguel looks at
      the photo in his hand. He moves his thumb to reveal the
      skull head guitar. Then, a firework illuminates the skull
      head guitar that the statue holds. Miguel gets an idea.

      A sea of candles and flowers, families gathered at graves.

      Miguel slinks around the side of the tomb.   He looks in one
      of the windows.

      Inside, the famous guitar hangs above the crypt. Fireworks
      pop; bursts of light glint off the instrument. It seems to
      beckon him. He tries the window but it's locked.

      More fireworks shoot into the sky.

      Timing to the explosions, Miguel throws his shoulder into the
      rusted-shut window pane and forces it open with a scraping
      KRRRR-LANK! He slinks inside the tomb.


<b>      INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM

      Miguel drops down to the mausoleum floor. The noise from
      outside is muffled. He climbs onto the crypt, slightly
      moving the lid. He stifles a gasp.

      He crawls over the marble sarcophagus and comes face-to-face
      with the famed guitar. Miguel wipes away a layer of dust,
      revealing the rich painted wood beneath. He looks up to the
      portrait of de la Cruz.

      Heart in his throat, Miguel lifts the guitar off its mount.
      Unbeknownst to him, some marigold petals in the mausoleum
      begin to sparkle.

      Confidence building, he strums it once.

      The air around him vibrates -- radiating like a shock wave.
      The petals on the ground whirl and surge with light for just
      a moment. Miguel is visibly taken aback. What just

      Frantic, Miguel trips and falls into an open grave.      A nearby
      woman gasps and peeks over the ledge of the grave.

<b>                              WOMAN

      They see each other face to face.       The woman is a skeleton!
      Miguel screams! She does too!

      Miguel backs away. He turns to see another skeleton. He
      falls backwards and scoots away frantically. He bumps into
      another skeleton whose head falls off and lands in Miguel's
      hands.

      Miguel tosses the head away from him and turns to see the
      whole cemetery is teeming with skeletons! And they can all
      see him!

      He races off and hides behind a grave. After a moment, he
      peeks over the headstone to watch the skeletons engaging with
      their living families.

      One couple dances.

      Another man reaches for offerings on his grave, which
      solidify in his hands when he takes them.

      mustached skeleton and falls to the ground. The skeleton's
      bones break apart and scatter. The head pops up.

      The family passes through an invisible barrier onto the
      bridge. Their bodies change from ghostly to solid. Miguel
      hesitates at the threshold.

      Miguel runs after Dante, finally catching up to the dog as he
      rolls in the petals at the crest of the bridge. He sneezes
      some petals into Miguel's face.

      at Miguel as she walks in the opposite direction. Miguel
      puts up his hood.

      The Riveras continue on toward an arrivals area on the far
      side of the bridge. Miguel sees fantastical creatures
      crawling, flying, making nests in the nearby architecture.

      Héctor bolts for the bridge. A security guards blocks the
      gate. Héctor splits in two and slides past the guard, half
      going over, half under.

</b>                  Ha HA!

      Héctor reaches the bridge at a sprint, but the magic doesn't
      engage; he sinks right into the petals.

</b>                  Almost there, just a little

      The guards saunter to the bridge and casually pull Héctor
      back toward the Land of the Dead.

      up in time to see his back.

      around the gate. The arrivals agent leans out from his

      turns, shocked to see him back so soon.

      Miguel realizes his hands are still in guitar-holding
      position.

      the upper floor. The Dead Riveras are there. Tío Oscar asks
      a PATROLWOMAN about a boy of Miguel's height. The
      patrolwoman picks up her walkie-talkie.

      CECILIA, a costumer, turns from a costume to look at the

      Miguel follows Dante through a giant warehouse, divided into
      different artists workspaces. He passes papier-mâché
      sculptures, giant paper cut out banners, a skeleton posing
      nude for a painter...

      Dante sniffs around. Suddenly an ALEBRIJE MONKEY jumps out
      at Dante. The monkey starts riding Dante, tormenting him.
      Miguel hustles after him.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  No, no, Dante! Ven acá!

      The monkey jumps up onto the shoulder of FRIDA KAHLO, the
      REAL Frida Kahlo, who stands in front of a rehearsal stage.
      Miguel reins Dante in just as Frida turns to find them.

      Frida's eyes go wide when she sees Dante.            She kneels and
      takes his head in her hands.

<b>                             FRIDA

                  And whose spirit have you guided to
                  me?

      Frida takes a closer look at Miguel.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  I don't think he's a spirit guide.

                  are as mysterious as they are
                  powerful...

      The patterns on Frida's monkey swirl and he opens his mouth
      to breath a blue fire. He fumbles at the end with a chesty
      cough.

      Then they look to Dante, who is chewing his own leg.
      Suddenly, Frida turns back to Miguel.

<b>                            FRIDA (CONT'D)

                  A giant PAPAYA!

      Lights come up on a giant papaya prop.

                  the dancers are all me!

      Leotarded, unibrowed dancers crawl around the sides of the
      mesh papaya. Behind the papaya is an even larger half-
      finished mesh structure.

                  is not milk but tears.

      tune.

</b>                  Well, if you really want to get to
                  Ernesto, there IS that music
                  competition at the Plaza de la
                  Cruz. Winner gets to play at his
                  party...

      Miguel's wheels start turning.

<b>                            HÉCTOR

                  if you think--

      Miguel looks to his hands, progressed in their skeletal
      transformation.

<b>                            MIGUEL

      Miguel looks up to Héctor.

      Héctor sighs.

</b>
      Pepita sweeps across the sky, landing in a darkened corner.
      She casts a shadow on the wall, then lurches into the light.
      She sniffs out the spot where Héctor painted Miguel's face,
      finding a canister of shoe polish. She lets out a low growl.

      The Dead Riveras follow after her.

                  you found our boy?

      Pepita breathes on the ground, revealing a footprint.   It
      glows for a moment. The family leans in to inspect.

      reveal a trail of footprints.

      Miguel follows Héctor down a steep stairway.     Miguel looks to
      his bony knuckles, concern on his face.

</b>                  Whadda you know?

      As Miguel descends the staircase, de la Cruz's distant
      glowing tower is obscured by old forgotten buildings.

      Héctor jumps from the stairway and crashes on the ground
      below. But his bones reassemble immediately.

      Héctor leads Miguel through a stone archway.


<b>      EXT. SHANTY TOWN
</b>
      Graffiti on the archway depicts skeletal angels with wings
      the color of marigolds.

      Inside the archway, a group of ratty skeletons huddle around
      a burning trashcan and laugh raucously. They are gray and
      dusty, not unlike Héctor, but there's a camaraderie about
      them.

      They approach three old ladies playing cards around a wooden
      crate. One, TÍA CHELO looks up.

<b>      INT. SHANTY BUNGALOW TENT
</b>
      Héctor holds the curtain open.       Miguel and Dante walk in.

      The tent is cramped, dark, and quiet. Piles are organized
      everywhere: stacks of old dishes, a drawer full of pocket
      watches, magazines, records. This place belongs to a
      collector of things. Miguel almost knocks one stack over.

      Héctor spies a hammock piled with old junk, a dusty hat on
      top. He lifts the hat and finds the grumpy face of
<b>      CHICHARRÓN.
</b>
<b>                            HÉCTOR

                  is... me and my friend, Miguel, we

      Chicharrón sits up, incensed.

<b>                            CHICHARRÓN
</b>                  Like the time you promised to bring
                  back my van?

<b>                            HÉCTOR

<b>                            CHICHARRÓN

      Chicharrón raises his finger to give a tongue lashing. But
      then he weakens and collapses in his hammock, a golden
      flicker flashing through his bones. Héctor rushes forward.

<b>                            HÉCTOR
</b>                  Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo?

<b>                             CHICHARRÓN
</b>                  I'm fading, Héctor. I can feel it.
                      (looking to guitar)
                  I couldn't even play that thing if
                  I wanted to.
                      (beat)
                  You play me something.

      Héctor looks surprised.

<b>                                                                           66.

<b>                            CHICHARRÓN
</b>                  You want it, you got to earn it...

      Héctor sighs, then reaches over Chicharrón and takes the
      instrument.

<b>                            HÉCTOR
</b>                  Only for you, amigo.     Any requests?

      Héctor begins tuning the guitar.

<b>                            CHICHARRÓN
</b>                  You know my favorite, Héctor.

      Héctor begins a lovely, lilting tune. Chicharrón smiles.
      Miguel's eyes go wide at Héctor's skill.

<b>                             HÉCTOR

</b><b>                  SHE'D POSSIBLY GIVE ME A CHANCE!
</b>
      Héctor finishes with a soft flourish.

      Chicharrón is tickled, joyful.       For a moment he's present and
      bright.

<b>                            CHICHARRÓN
</b>                  Brings back memories.     Gracias...

      His eyes close.    He looks at peace.        Héctor looks sad.

      Suddenly, the edges of Chicharrón's bones begin to glow.         A
      soft, beautiful light. Then... he dissolves into dust.




<b>                                                                  67.
</b>

      Miguel is stunned, concerned.

      Héctor picks up his shot glass, lifts it in honor, and
      drinks. He places it rim down next to Chicharrón's glass,
      which is still full.

<b>                            MIGUEL

      Miguel has a thought.

      Héctor puts his hand on Miguel's back, suddenly cheerful.

      Héctor throws open the curtain and exits.      Miguel looks back
      at the glasses, then turns and follows.


<b>      EXT. LAND OF THE DEAD

      Héctor and Miguel hang off the back of a moving trolley.
      Miguel holds Héctor's photo in his hands, scanning it, while
      Héctor fiddles on the guitar idly.

      intro.

      Miguel hustles to get away from Héctor. Dante bounds after
      him, but looks back and whimpers. He barks to get Miguel's
      attention.

      him off, but his hoodie slips off, revealing the arms of a
      living boy. Dante redoubles his efforts.

      Startled skeletons see Miguel's arms.        He hurries to get his
      hoodie back on.

      Miguel runs and jumps down some scaffolding. In the
      distance, he sees de la Cruz's tower. After only a few
      paces, Pepita lands in front of Miguel, cutting off his path!
      He skids to a stop.

      Then, peeking over the jaguar's head is an even more
      terrifying sight: Mamá Imelda riding atop.

<b>                            MAMÁ IMELDA

      Miguel stops in his tracks.      When Imelda finishes, he turns
      back, confused.

                  I remember that feeling, when my
                  husband would play, and I would
                  sing and nothing else mattered.
                  But when we had Coco, suddenly...
                  there was something in my life that
                  mattered more than music. I wanted
                  to put down roots. He wanted to
                  play for the world.

      Mamá Imelda pauses for a moment, lost in a memory.

      Miguel wipes the corner of his eye, frustrated. Imelda is
      shocked to see him so hurt, but Miguel turns away before she
      can answer and ascends the narrow staircase toward de la
      Cruz's tower.


<b>      EXT. BOTTOM OF THE TOWER
</b>
      Miguel arrives at the foot of the hill to de la Cruz's tower.

      Vehicles from all eras (limousines, motor cars, carriages)
      drop off finely dressed guests who line up to get aboard a
      funicular that scales the tower to the mansion.

      A couple at the front of the line show a fancy invitation to
      a SECURITY GUARD, who then lets them onto the funicular.

      El Santo nods. The security guard removes his head and hands
      it to the luchador for a selfie. His body proceeds to take
      the photo.

      The security guard puts his head back on and El Santo heads
      past the velvet rope. Miguel is revealed waiting in line
      behind him.

      Los Chachalacos file onto the funicular, the sousaphone
      player angling his instrument away from the security guard.
      After they get onto the funicular, he turns to reveal a pair
      of legs hanging out of the bell of the sousaphone. With a
      deep "TOOT!" Miguel spills out onto the floor of the

      Miguel heads off toward the mansion.

      On the stairs leading up, the party is bustling --
      performers, servers and guests dressed to the nines.

      A fire breather lets out flames that transform into a flurry
      of butterflies.

      the party. Miguel pursues.

                  de la--

      He finds himself in a huge hall with hundreds of guests, the
      heart of the party. Film clips play all around the room from
      de la Cruz's movies.

      Miguel takes it all in. Synchronized swimmers make
      formations in a sparkling indoor pool. A DJ lays a decades-
      spanning mash-up soundtrack.

      A clip of de la Cruz riding his noble steed plays behind
      Miguel.

      Miguel is unable to get his great-great grandfather's
      attention. Meanwhile, a clip behind Miguel features de la
      Cruz as a good-natured priest:

<b>                            NUN (FILM CLIP)

      The passionate words embolden Miguel. He climbs a pillar to
      the landing of a grand staircase, he stands above the crowd.

      Miguel takes a breath and throws out a grito as loud as he
      can. It echoes through the space, and party guests turn.
      The DJ fades the music.

      Garnering some attention, Miguel plays his guitar.   More
      guests turn.

      As a hush falls on the crowd, the sound of Miguel's guitar
      becomes singular.

      He passes a movie screen where a clip features de la Cruz
      singing the same song in one of his films, the songs
      overlapping for a brief moment.

      The party-goers gasp, but it's Ernesto who rolls up his
      sleeves, and, in true movie hero fashion, jumps into the pool
      and lifts a coughing Miguel to the edge.

      rises to his feet, hands defensively on Miguel's shoulders.

      intercepts it.

      He looks from the picture to the gray, faded skeleton who
      kneels before him. Héctor looks weak.

                  your moment. I know      you
                  understand.

      Miguel is dragged away.

      The guards drag Miguel out the back of de la Cruz's mansion.

</b>                  Let go!

      They throw him into a cenote, an inescapable sinkhole behind
      the estate.

      He falls four stories and splashes into the pool at the
      bottom of the hole. He breaks the surface and swims to a
      stone island in the center.

<b>                           MIGUEL
</b>                  Help! Can anyone hear me?        I wanna
                  go home!

      Miguel collapses on the stone island.

      His soaked hoodie sags off his shoulders.        The skeletal
      transition is almost complete.

      A moment of silence.     He is alone.

      Suddenly, Miguel hears a noise. Footsteps. Héctor emerges
      from the darkness, looking beat up. Héctor stumbles.

<b>                              MIGUEL

      They run to each other.      Héctor embraces Miguel.   But Miguel
      is overcome with shame.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  You were right. I should have gone
                  back to my family--

      Héctor tries to calm him but Miguel is shaking.

<b>                            HÉCTOR

                  was on their stupid ofrenda.

      Héctor holds Miguel to his chest.       Miguel is tense.

      Suddenly, a golden flicker flutters through Héctor's bones,
      and he falls to his knees.

                  papá was trying to come home. That
                  he loved her so much.

                  My Coco...

      A chill runs through Miguel.

</b>                  Coco?

      Miguel reaches into his hoodie and pulls out the photo of
      Imelda, Coco, and the faceless musician.

      Miguel shows the photo to Héctor.       Héctor is confused; it's
      like he's seen a ghost.

      Gears turn in both of their heads.

      Héctor is as shocked as Miguel.       He looks at his great-great
      grandson.

      He looks to the photo, touches the image of baby Coco, and he
      becomes saddened.

<b>                              HÉCTOR

<b>                             HÉCTOR

                   apart we were. What I wouldn't

      They trade off their gritos until the cenote echoes with the
      sound. Soon though, the echoes fade. They're still stuck.
      Suddenly they hear a distant howling.

      Dante pants and wags his tail happily. Behind him Pepita
      peeks down through the hole and gives a powerful roar.
      Pepita's call shakes the cavern. She lowers her head to
      reveal Mamá Imelda riding atop her. Miguel and Mamá Imelda
      laugh with joy. Until her gaze falls upon Héctor.

      Dante ride on her back. She ascends above the clouds.


<b>      EXT. NIGHT SKY

      Miguel, wind in his hair, hugs Dante fiercely.

      Dante smiles at Miguel dumbly. Suddenly, before Miguel's
      eyes, neon patterns spread outward from the dog's paws.
      Dante begins to freak out.

<b>                              MIGUEL

      off, a full-blown spirit guide!

      They dismount from Pepita. Héctor falls off first but gets
      up and raises his arm to help Imelda. She gives him a
      withering stare and dismounts without his help. Miguel pets
      Dante and Pepita gives Miguel a big lick.

      Imelda rounds Pepita's shoulder and folds Miguel into a tight
      hug.

      sheepishly.

<b>      EXT. SUNRISE SPECTACULAR AMPHITHEATER - BEFORE DAWN
</b>
      Crowds are congregated at de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular
      which takes place in an open air amphitheater. They hurry to
      their seats as the lights begin to dim.


<b>      ON STAGE
</b>
      Frida's performance piece begins. Dramatic symphonic music
      plays as a giant papaya appears to ignite on stage. The
      "seeds" in the body of the papaya unfurl to reveal that they
      are dancers, each dressed like Frida Kahlo, right down to the
      painted on unibrow.

      The dancers roll out of the "flaming" papaya and gyrate their
      bodies nonsensically.

      A giant cactus that resembles Frida is illuminated, and all
      the dancers slink to it.

      In the midst of this, eight familiar looking dancers (the
      Dead Riveras and Miguel) inch their way out of the spotlights
      and to the wings of the stage.

      The Dead Riveras congregate in a hidden backstage corridor,
      shedding their Frida outfits. Miguel rips off his unibrow.

      As security guards try to wrangle the Riveras, Imelda reaches
      de la Cruz and gets her hands on Héctor's photo. De la Cruz
      scuffles with her to get it back, when Miguel tackles de la
      Cruz to the ground. De la Cruz loses his grip; Imelda
      tumbles backward, photo in hand.

      Miguel turns toward Imelda but is chased by guards.

      Suddenly, Imelda rises into the air. She is on de la Cruz's
      rising platform! She is lifted through the ceiling and up to
      the stage.

      De la Cruz hurries up the stairs after her.

      Miguel is detained by a security guard when Dante flies in
      and knocks the guard's head clean off. Miguel, Héctor, Tía

      The guards reach the edge of her spotlight but stop short,
      not wanting to interrupt the performance.

      Imelda takes the spotlight with her as she descends the on
      stage staircase. As she comes down, she makes eye contact
      with her husband in the wing. He smiles as he accompanies
      her. Imelda's eyes glint, touched to see him supporting her.

      As Héctor accompanies Imelda, she becomes more confident.
      The audience begins to clap.

      De la Cruz grunts in frustration.

      Soon, the stage conductor joins with more instrumentation,
      which kicks into high gear.

      She doubles down on her performance, taking the spotlight
      with her as she moves to put distance between her and the
      guards.

      Imelda continues to vamp, trying to navigate away from the
      guards and toward her family. One guard blocks her way, but
      she grabs him and forces him to dance. Scared of the
      spotlight, he runs away.

      Héctor can barely move his limbs.

      Mamá Imelda looks to the horizon, the first rays of sunlight
      peeking over.

                  promised you'd see Coco!

      Héctor looks at Miguel. The skeletal transformation is
      creeping in on the edges of Miguel's face. He's almost full
      skeleton now.

<b>                            HÉCTOR

      The shimmering of Héctor's bones advances.

<b>                            MIGUEL
</b>                  No, no... she can't forget you!

      Héctor musters the strength to grab the marigold petal.

      The petal glows.

      Héctor struggles to lift the petal to Miguel.      Mamá Imelda
      takes his hand in hers.

      Miguel finds himself back in de la Cruz's tomb.

      Dazed, he looks through the windows; day has broken.

      On the floor is the skull guitar. Miguel grabs it.      He exits
      the tomb and takes off out of the cemetery.

<b>      EXT. PLAZA
</b>
      Miguel races through the plaza, past the statue of de la
      Cruz.

      Miguel races through the streets towards home. He blows
      right past his Tío Berto snoring and Primo Abel sleeping on a
      bench.

      Abel falls off the bench.

      Papá comes from around a corner as Miguel is running.

<b>      EXT. RIVERA COMPOUND

      Miguel rounds the corner and follows the trail of marigolds
      through the front gate.

      He runs for Mamá Coco's bedroom. Just as he makes it to the
      doorway, Abuelita steps up and blocks him.

      Miguel locks the door and goes up to Mamá Coco.      She stares
      into space, eyes completely vacant.

<b>                               MIGUEL

      Still nothing.    Her eyes are glazed.

      With a rattle of keys, the door flies open.    The family pours
      in.

      Abuelita brushes Miguel aside to comfort her mother.

      Miguel looks down, defeated. Tears drip off his nose.
      Papá's anger gives way to relief. He embraces his son.

<b>                            PAPÁ

</b>                  Mamá Coco...

      His toe accidentally taps against Héctor's skull guitar, a
      soft hollow ringing resonates.

<b>                             ABUELITA
</b>                  Well?   Apologize.

      He comes to a realization.

</b>                  Mamá Coco? Your papá -- he wanted

      He picks up the guitar. Abuelita steps forward to intervene
      but Papá places a hand on her shoulder.

<b>                            PAPÁ
</b>                  Mamá, wait--

      Miguel starts to sing "Remember Me" the way Héctor sang it...
      softly, from the heart.

      The glimmer in the Mamá Coco's eyes grows brighter with every
      note. Memories flood in, filling the vacancy of her
      expression with life. Her cheeks soften and plump. Her lips
      arc into a smile.

      Miguel sings gently, with love.

      Mamá Coco's brows slope up, delighted.          The song seems to
      bring her back to life.

      Abuelita can't speak.     None of them can.

      Brimming, Mamá Coco joins Miguel in song -- her voice
      scratchy with age, his clear with youth.

</b>
      Tears stream down Abuelita's face; she's witnessing a
      miracle.

      Mamá Coco looks to her daughter, and is troubled by her
      tears.

<b>                             MAMÁ COCO

<b>                            MAMÁ COCO

                  loved you so much.

      A smile spreads across Mamá Coco's face.          She's waited a long
      time to hear those words.

      She turns to her nightstand, hand shaking.          She opens a
      drawer and pulls out a notebook.

</b>

      Mamá Coco leafs through the book to reveal a torn scrap of
      paper. She hands it to Miguel. It's the missing face from
      the photo -- Héctor's face.

      Miguel pieces the picture back together, finally seeing
      Héctor as he was in life, a young, handsome man.

      Mamá Coco smiles. She finds the words slowly, but she speaks
      with fondness and love.

      Héctor steps up to the monitor. The agent recognizes him.
      Héctor chuckles nervously. The monitor scans him. DING!

</b><b>                  THAT I DREAMED ABOUT YOU
</b>
      Héctor's chest swells.

<b>      EXT. FOOT OF THE BRIDGE
</b>
      Héctor exits from the Marigold Grand Central Station. Mamá
      Imelda waits on the cobblestones to greet him. They kiss.
      Then he hears a familiar voice.

<b>                              MAMÁ COCO
</b>                  Papá!

      Héctor turns to see his daughter approaching.   He opens his
      arms to give Coco the biggest hug.

<b>                              HÉCTOR

</b>
      Every moment together is a miracle and he holds Coco like he
      knows it. Soon Coco, Héctor, and Imelda join hands. The
      petals of the bridge glow as they step forward. The family
      crosses together.

      Dante and Pepita fly through the night sky in the Land of the
      Dead. They alight on the marigold path and bound across into
      the Land of the Living.

      Dante's shadow is cast against a wall. When he rounds the
      corner, he is just a normal xolo dog, no wings or vibrant
      colors. Pepita's shadow looms large, but as she rounds the
      corner it shrinks to reveal that she is a little alley cat in
      the Land of the Living.


<b>      EXT. RIVERA COURTYARD
</b>
      They enter the Rivera compound. Abuelita greets Dante and
      tosses him a sweet treat. In the courtyard, the family is
      gathered as Miguel plays his guitar and sings. Dante hops up
      to give him a lick on the cheek.

      Amongst the living Riveras are the spirits of their loved
      ones, Tía Rosita, Tía Victoria, Papá Julio, Tío Oscar and Tío
      Felipe, all present and enjoying the reunion.

      Abel and Rosa accompany Miguel with instruments of their own.
      Papá cradles Miguel's new baby sister as Mamá leans on his
      shoulder. Abuelita listens proudly to her grandchildren
      while the spirit of Mamá Coco stands beside, arm around her
      shoulder.

      The courtyard is full of Riveras, living and dead. Héctor
      and Imelda stand arm in arm, listening to Miguel play. As
      Miguel sings, the whole family, living and dead, all sing,
      play and enjoy the music.

      The whole family, brought together by a song.
