          Colored light from the billboard flickers over a bullet
          riddled sign: ROUTE 85. U.S. BORDER, EL PASO, TEXAS.
                         
          Beneath the sign is a LONG BLACK LIMOUSINE.
                         
          Cars whip past on the highway. Then A VAN passes, blasting
          some future version of Techno Latino Hip Hop. A SQUEAL OF
          TIRES OS. Now the music gets louder as the van returns,
          cruising slowly past the black limo before pulling into the
          lot. Five Bangers bail out and check out the black stretch.
                         
          The limo doors are locked, windows tinted, so they can't see
          what's inside, but they check out the tires and wheels and
          like what they see. With the speed of a pit crew, they open
          the back of the van and out come TOOLS AND A JACK.

          We move over the back bench, past empty bottles, fast food
          wrappers as A SLEEPING MAN'S FACE ratchets into frame.
          He opens his red eyes.
                         
          The man is LOGAN aka The Wolverine or more accurately, Drunk
          Wolverine. He blinks, dazed, feeling the car lurching upward.
          Older than we've seen him, he clutches a Tequila bottle.

          As the back door opens, the tequila bottle drops to the dirt
          and A BOOTED LEG STEPS OUT.
                         
          Logan shuffles, stiff, to the other side of the stretch where
          the Bangers work, removing wheels, lit by colored light.

            Now might be a good time to talk about "fights" described in
            the next 100 or so pages. Basically, if you're on the make
            for a hyper choreographed, gravity defying, city-block
            destroying, CG fuckathon, this ain't your movie.
                         
            In this flick, people will get hurt or killed when shit falls
            on them. They will get just as hurt or just as killed if they
            get hit with something big and heavy like, say, a car. Should
            anyone in our story have the misfortune to fall off a roof or
            out a window, they won't bounce. They will die.
                         
            As for our hero with his so-called eternal life and healing.
            Well, he's older now. If you keep reading, you'll discover
            Logan's about to get his ass kicked. But before we get to
            that, we should make it clear his abilities ain't what they
            were. Yes, he's a drunk, but he's also fading on the inside.
            Adamantium implants leeching into his system, causing chronic
            pain and diminished healing, hence booze as painkiller.
                         
            So by all means, go ahead and worry about him.
            Now where were we? Oh, yeah--
                         
            As the smoke settles, a CROWBAR-toting Banger angrily chews
            out Jitters in Spanish for firing. The others resume their
            work... none aware of Logan slowly getting up, till --

                      You don't wanna do this.
                         
            The Bangers react to Logan with bafflement. Ad-lib Spanish
            reactions, nervous chuckles --
                         
            CROWBAR presses down JITTER'S gun as he moves to Logan.
                         
            We hear a familiar SNIKT! as claws slowly extend from one of
            Logan's hands, then mostly extend from the other. Logan is
            still frowning at his bad hand when--
                         
            CROWBAR THWACKS HIS SKULL. A metallic ring.
                         
            Off balance and pissed, Logan swings at them as they
            converge, but he's drunk and soon they are pounding him with
            knives and guns and fists and a torque wrench.
          Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                    3.
                         
                         
            He tries his best to keep them from the limo, catches one
            guy's bat an inch before it would dent the car.
                         
            Another one of them shoots in that direction, but Logan puts
            himself in front of the bullet. The pain from that little
            move stops him long enough for them to resume the pummeling.
                         
            Suddenly, Logan's eyes go yellow, pupils dilating. He lets
            out a long, loud yell. Fury rockets up in him, like cocaine.
                         
            HE STANDS AND RAMS HIS CLAWS INTO CROWBAR and kicks another
            Banger into the back of the open van. Yet another runs at
            Logan only to get gored in the neck and tossed. This is real
            work for Logan, not easy. And it is fueled by rage.
                         
            Jitters again raises his sawed-off, he will nail the car for
            sure, but Logan slices off his arm above the elbow.
                         
            Sadly for Logan, the hand, while disconnected from the body
            it once belonged to, is still holding the gun. So, as it hits
            the dirt, the gun goes off, putting several pellet-sized
            holes in the door of the limo.
                         
            This, more than anything else, doubles Logan anger--

            who, seeing he had his chance, leaps into the van and spins
            out of the lot, his wounded compadre in back, spilling onto
            the dirt as the van bounces back onto the road.
                         
            Logan picks up his keys, some loose change and a single
            silver bullet. He stands, staring at the holes in his
            otherwise pristine stretch as RAIN BEGINS TO FALL.
                         
            He sucks in deep breaths, forcing himself to regain control.
            His eyes return to normalcy. A PHONE VIBRATES OS. Logan takes
            out his, looks at it (he's got a fare), kicks the jack from
            the under the chassis.
                         
            WE CRANE UP as Logan starts up the stretch and makes a loop
            in the lot, taking care to run over the three remaining
            Bangers before laying rubber onto the highway...

            A PAGE FROM A SPANISH PENNY SAVER -- a USED 70 FT. SUNSEEKER

            Federales open fire at the limo as Logan guns the engine in
            reverse, trying to get traction on the dirt. Other Federales
            speed toward them on motorcycles.
                         
            Under massive fire, bullet-riddled, Logan's limo finds
            purchase, and he's backing out at high speed, ripping a long
            section of chain link from its posts and dragging this "tail"
            with him (driving backwards now).

            The Reaver claws his way along the chain link toward the hood
            of the car, drawing his gun, firing at the windshield.
                         
            Logan ducks and spins the car around. The dragging fence
            swings wide, LOSING THE REAVER ON THE FENCE.
                         
            Pierce angrily peels his truck in another direction.
                         
            Logan sees the main gate ahead. As he guns for it, he notices
            THE FLASHING RED TRAIN-WARNING LIGHTS at the loading dock.
                         
            TWO FEDERALE JEEPS reach the sides of the limo, guns aimed
            squarely at Logan. Laura and Charles react as--

            Logan makes a hard left, cranking the wheel just clipping the
            front corner of Pierce's truck, spinning toward the tracks.

            entrance. Gets out and does not give the keys to the Valet--

            standing at the entrance, talking in a cell phone.

            A HOTEL GARDENER with a hedge trimmer, touching up a shrub.
            Looking for a side entrance, Logan passes other patrons, but
            as he does, he clocks--
                         
            BLACK VEHICLES parked in a service entrance. And that's when

            see the Worker unconscious on the ground, the hedge trimmer
            whirring and bouncing in the grass.

                      to hunt and foot claws for defense.
                      They use the foot claw to strike
                      the belly or bladder of the
                      attacker, thus ensuring their
                      escape and survival.

            In the back seat of the pick up sits A TEENAGE BOY. He looks

            The Munson family and the "Howlett" family all sit around a

            All except Laura who looks around at the family pictures, the
            religious decorations (they are everywhere), the warm

            Rodeo trophies, posters, etc. The room of a kid who loves
            everything about that world. Nate -- ear buds in -- does his

            LAURA standing in the doorway watching his every move.
            She looks at the trophies, curious.

            She looks at the pad's screen. A series of equations with
            blanks to fill in and chicken scratch in the digital margins.
            He pulls out one of the buds, waves a stylus, and explains--

                   We have never seen him before like this.
                         
                   He is Weapon X in a full berserker rage. His body restored by
                   the huge dose of the drug, he cuts his way through Reavers
                   and Soldiers one after another like a saw blade. They fire on
                   him but it doesn't matter, he heals instantly. Each of them
                   are gored and slashed and killed as Logan races toward the
                   children up ahead, overtaking the Alkali convoy.

            And then the father and daughter move on, chasing after the

            Laura turns back as--
                         
            X-24 GRABS LOGAN AND TOSSES HIM LIKE A RAG DOLL into open
            door of the control van.
                         
            Bleary, Logan grabs the fallen door, summons his remaining
            strength and smashes X24 with it, knocking the monster to the
            dirt. Logan reaches deep, bringing the iron door down like a
            guillotine on X-24's throat.
                         
            Rictor come to consciousness in the grass, his eyes finding--
                         
            X24, pinned on the ground, struggling to breathe, the van
            door pressing against his neck. X24 catches sight of Dr.
            Rice, his fallen master.
                         
            Pierce watches, his survival riding on X24's ability to get
            up and defeat Logan.

            X24 howls in rage and breaks Logan's hold, leaping at Logan,
            mauling him and hurling his limp, bloody body beyond the
            jeeps.
                         
            Satisfied with himself, X24 is shocked when--

            Pierce grabs a crossbow from the van and aims it at Logan. He
            fires, harpooning Logan's leg. He howls in pain.
                         
            Pierce ties off the harpoon able and tosses the crossbow and
            flees to his jeep, looking to escape but suddenly he is
            cornered by --
                         
            THE NEWLY FREED MUTANT CHILDREN COMING AT HIM, each enraged,
            aiming their fledgling mutant powers at him. They form a
            circle, trapping him, freezing him, entangling him, shocking
            him and burning him, all at once. Pierce cries in agony. They
            have no mercy for their lifelong oppressor.

            Bloodied and cut, X24 manages to get a hold of Laura -- he
            hurls her off his back into a tree... hard. She lies there,
            limp at the base of the tree.

            Rictor extends his hands and with all his energy projects his
            power to the ground beneath the Control Van.
                         
            Laura regains consciousness, noticing the empty pistol a few
            feet away from her in the grass. Then she sees--

            Rictor screams as the power of his mutancy ripples through
            him and with one last push --
                         
            He releases the rocks beneath the van--
                         
<b>            AND THE HUGE VEHICLE TOPPLES ONTO X24, CRUSHING HIM.

            their feet, mummified in ice, blood and twisted grass.
                         
            Logan gets to his feet and reaches out for Laura.

            Suddenly, the is a metallic CREAK AND KLUNK AND X24 EMERGES,
            BLOODIED, FROM BENEATH THE TOPPLED VAN. The children scream
            as the monster makes a run at them.

            Logan stumbles to position himself between the children and
            the unstoppable fully healed creature charging at him --
                         
            X-24 GORES LOGAN WITH BOTH HIS CLAWS and, using them like
            grappling hooks, drags Logan off to the forest's edge.

            X24 heaves Logan onto a fallen stump, A JAGGED WOOD LIMB
            SPEARING THROUGH LOGAN'S TORSO. Logan howls in pain.
                         
            Laura runs to the pistol in the grass. Pulls the Adamantium
            bullet from her pocket, fumbling to load the gun as--
                         
            Delirious, losing blood, LOGAN grabs helplessly at X24's
            claws (already plunged into him) as the monster jams them
            deeper, through him, and into the log-- then raises them for
            one last goring when --
                         
            X24's Adamantium skull suddenly explodes. He collapses to the
            ground. Done.
                         
            Laura stands ten feet away, holding the smoking pistol. Her
            eyes meet Logan's and she drops the gun and runs to him.

            to the forest floor. He struggles to breathe. His body is
            decimated, his skeleton showing through his wounds.
                         
            Laura's eyes are wild and fearful. She can see he is mortally
            wounded... She kneels.

            Logan watches them all, his eyes glassy, his body still.
            Laura takes Logan's bloody hand, and this time, he holds on.

            And in his eyes, there is a flicker of wonder.

            Laura squeezes his limp hand. Disbelieving that he has
            passed. But there is nothing left in him.
                         
            Still holding his hand, Laura looks up at her friends, tears
            in her eyes. The other children gather closer.
                         
            WIDER ON -- ALL THE CHILDREN IN A CIRCLE AROUND LOGAN. They
            just stand there in the blast-radius of the carnage as the

            But Laura hesitates, still looking at Logan's grave. She does
            not move, but then, tearful, grabs her own backpack. As she
            passes Logan's makeshift cross, she looks at it a moment,
