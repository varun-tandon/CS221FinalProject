</b>
          A million suns shine in the dark.
          A STARSHIP cuts through the night: a gleaming white cruiser.
          Galleries of windows. Flying decks and observation domes.
          On the hull: EXCELSIOR - A HomeStead Company Starship.
          The ship flashes through a nebula. Space-dust sparkles as it
          whips over the hull, betraying the ship's dizzying speed.
          The nebula boils in the ship's wake. The Excelsior rockets
          on, spotless and beautiful as a daydream.

          A wide plaza. Its lofty atrium cuts through seven decks,
          creating tiers of promenades framing a vast skylight.
          The promenades are empty. Chairs unoccupied. Beetle-like
          robots vacuum the carpets and wax the floors.

          each tube stands a PASSENGER. Eyes closed in sleep. If
          they're breathing you can't tell by looking.
          They sleep on their feet, leaning against padded supports.
          Straps secure them in place; sensors adhere to their skin.
          They wear shorts and tank tops with HomeStead Company logos.
          We survey their faces. No children, no senior citizens. Men
          and women of every ethnicity in the prime of their lives.
          We settle on one man. JIM PRESTON, 38. Sound asleep. A small

          Lights wink on in Jim's hibernation pod. Machinery hums to
          life. Instruments beep and chitter.
          Medical data fills the pod's screen. Jim's temperature rises.
          His heart begins to beat. He takes a breath.
          Jim opens his eyes.
          Groggy, blinking, seeing nothing.
          The backrest behind him converts into a recliner, lowering
          him into a seated position.
          The sensors on his skin drop off and snake back into the
          pod's machinery.
          A video screen descends before Jim's eyes.
          ONSCREEN - A beautiful stewardess appears, beaming at the

</b>                    Hi. I'm Jim Preston. I'm a passenger
                    on the Excelsior. Something went
                    wrong with my hibernation pod and I
                    woke up too soon. Ninety years too
                    soon. I can't get back to sleep.
                    Nobody else is awake.
                        (with growing panic)
                    If I don't figure something out, I'm
                    going to die of old age before we get
                    to Homestead II. So help me out here.
                        (takes a deep breath)
                    I'll keep trying to fix this. Maybe I
                    missed something simple. But I could
                    use a hand. Thanks.
          Jim pushes the "SEND" button. Sits back in his chair.

          slippers. He looks shell-shocked.
          He comes to the Concourse Bar: the fanciest watering hole on
          the ship. Black leather stools along a marble bartop.
          Jim touches the bartop...and a MAN swings up behind the bar -
          as if mounted on a hinge. A handsome fellow in a bartender's
          uniform - his hair and skin eerily perfect. This is ARTHUR.

          movement, he glides the length of the bar, polishing all the
          way, and glides back as if on roller skates.
          Jim steps up on the footrail and peers behind the bar.

          He assumes the position, his back against the backrest,
          waiting for the pod to put him to sleep.
          Nothing happens. He pokes at the ports where the sensors and
          intravenous lines used to protrude. Shakes the machine.
          He gives up. It's not working.
          But now he's trapped inside the pod.
          He pushes at the canopy, but it's locked shut. He pounds on

          his tools and his manual, his discarded shirt.
          Then he notices the emergency release handle down by the

          fly. He's drenched in sweat. Mussed and unshaven.
          He lifts the goggles and inspects the door. The laser cutter
          has barely marked the surface.
          The door's a mess. Its switch hangs on wires. There are pry
          marks around the latch. Gouges around the window. Failed
          drill holes. Dents left by an axe.
          But the door stands firm.
          Jim lets the laser cutter fall. It joins a scrapyard of tools
          on the floor: sledgehammer, jackhammer, drill, crowbar, axe.

                    desert island, and you had the power
                    to wish somebody there with you. You
                    wouldn't be alone anymore, but you'd
                    be stranding another person on the

                    something that would make your life a
                    hundred times better. But it's wrong,
                    and there's no taking it back. How
                    wrong would it have to be to stop
                    you? I mean, what if it made your
                    life a thousand times better? How do

                    use some company.

          The ship forges through space, its lit windows shining.
          Jim paces back and forth on a promenade, a tiny figure
          dwarfed by the mighty ship and the tapestry of stars.

                         

<b>          DECK TWO - HALL OF FAITH - DAY
</b>          Jim passes under a sign reading "Hall of Faith," into a
          circular walk.
          There's a small fountain in the middle of the circle. Around
          the edges, doors labeled: BUDDHISM, JUDAISM, HINDUISM,

<b>          CHRISTIANITY, ISLAM, OTHER FAITHS.
</b>          Jim walks the circle, looking through the doorways: a cross,
          a Buddha, an abstract sculpture in the "Other Faiths" chapel.
          He continues around the circle and out into the ship.

          The E.V.A. Room is dominated by an airlock. Spacesuits in
          racks. Tools, tethers, shuttle docking rings.
          Jim goes to the airlock. Opens the inner door.
          A BUZZER sounds a warning.

          He steps into the airlock. The door closes behind him.
          Jim looks at the red lever that opens the outer door. He
          grips the lever. Looks thoughtfully out at the stars.

          The airlock outer door opens with a blast of air. Jim emerges
          from the airlock - wearing a SPACE SUIT.
          He plants his feet on the hull and walks up the side of the
          ship on magnetic boots.

                       It's wrong, man.

          He finds a squadron of housekeeping robots waiting outside.
          He taps the "PLEASE SERVICE" button beside his door.
          The robots zoom inside with squeals of joy.

</b>          Jim stands in front of Aurora: toolbox in one hand, the
          technical manual in the other. He's breathing hard.
          He sets the toolbox down. Opens the manual. It's densely
          annotated in Jim's handwriting.
          He opens the pod's cover panel and goes to work, following
          the steps in his manual. His hands shake.
          He starts to close a final contact.
          Stops.
          Gets to his feet. Stands looking at Aurora.
          Quickly he kneels and completes the circuit. Pulls his hands
          away as if the metal had burned him.

          Aurora's pod hums. Medical data flows across its screen. Her
          vital signs re-start. Her pale skin flushes with color.
          Jim beats a retreat.

          then a deep one. Her chest rises and falls.
          Her thighs shift as she bends her knees. The sensors on her
          body drop off and withdraw into the pod.
          She opens her eyes. They're beautiful.
          Her pod's backrest flexes, scooping up her knees as it
          becomes a seat. A video screen drops in front of her.

          He splashes water on his face. Stares into the mirror.

          somber collection of portraits by Dutch masters. She frowns.
          Jim steps to her side and makes a selection.
          The walls fill with abstract landscapes - stark plains and
          oceans, with lonely figures isolated in the vastness.
          The images pull Jim and Aurora in: they stand before a dark

          Without thinking she reaches out and tucks her hand in the

</b>                    You are the most beautiful woman I've
                    ever seen. You're so beautiful it
                    hurts me.
          She stares, shocked. Leans across the table and kisses him.
          Soon they're making out right on top of breakfast.
          A passing robot pauses to observe the scene - then moves on.

                         

<b>          SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>          1. Jim and Aurora make out fiercely in the movie theater
          while a movie plays onscreen.
          2. Aurora straddles Jim in a jacuzzi in the ship's Spa. She
          moves against him: she's close. She climaxes gorgeously.
          3. Jim stands on a promenade. Aurora passes, jogging. He
          gives her a smile as she goes by. A moment later she runs
          back into frame and tackles him. They tumble to the deck.

                         

<b>                         BERLIN SUITE
</b>          Jim and Aurora lie in Jim's imperial bed, glistening with
          sweat and breathing hard. She lays her head on his shoulder,
          her eyes far away and wistful.

          She waves her hand in the air as if to signify, all of this.

          She snuggles in tighter, and he holds her close.

          Through the window, Jim and Aurora lie together in the
          luxurious bed.
          We pull out, the window dwindling, as the Excelsior soars
          away from us into the stars.

</b>          The best suite on the ship. One one side of the bedroom,
          Aurora's mementos and possessions. On the other side, Jim's.
          They wake together. She kisses him on the cheek with the ease
          of long habit and heads for the shower. He watches her go.

                         

<b>          SWIMMING POOL - MORNING
</b>          Swimming, Aurora reaches the end of a lap. A hand reaches
          down and catches her before she can turn.
          Jim kneels at the edge of the pool, in coveralls and work
          boots, a tool belt slung over his shoulder.
          Aurora pulls herself up and kisses him.

<b>          FORWARD OBSERVATION DECK - DAY
</b>          Aurora writes on her sofa, surrounded by electronic slates,
          each displaying a reference book or research paper. On one, a
          map of the Polynesian archipelago.

                    Searching for islands. They sailed
                    into the endless sea on faith.

                         

<b>          SUBDECK A - NUMBER EIGHT CARGO HOLD - DAY
</b>          Jim walks among the towering cargo racks. His flashlight
          illuminates machines stacked from floor to ceiling: tractors
          and combines, helicopters and seaplanes.

</b>                    Some never returned, but others found
                    land, and prospered. What drove them
                    out onto the sea? Curiosity?
                    Tradition? The wish for something
                    better?
          Jim opens cargo containers. He finds ingots of metal,
          computer components, spools of superconducting wire. Raw
          materials for a young world.

</b>                    The urge to move is as primal as
                    hunger or thirst. We run, we drive,
                    we sail, we fly.
          Jim finds a stash of utility golf carts and his eyes light
          up. He unpacks one, starts it up. Drives off into the dark.

</b>          Jim drives his cart into a new bay - and stares in wonder.
          In oversized hibernation pods: cattle, horses, sheep, oxen.
          All asleep. Chickens, ducks and geese in individual cells.

                    The wind drives us - whether the

                    winds of chance.
          The next aisle holds plants in stasis: saplings in tubes,
          seedlings in individual vials.
          Jim stops in front of a glass case. Rosy light bathes his
          face. He smiles. We don't see why.

<b>          VIENNA SUITE - BEDROOM - EVENING
</b>          Aurora sits with her slate. Eyeing Jim's side of the room.
          Giving in, she begins to explore Jim's possessions: poking
          into the drawers of his nightstand and dresser.
          She opens his closet. Shifting things, she finds a dog-eared
          manual on hibernation pods. She pulls it out.
          There's a bookmark in the pages. She goes to open the book -
          and the bookmark slides into her hand.
          It's the photo strip Jim took during his isolation: Four
          identical shots of his face, bearded and hollow-eyed. The
          melancholy images hit her hard.
          She touches the pictures to make them move: but Jim sits
          immobile. In the fourth image, he sighs heavily.
          Voices in the hall.

                    I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore.
                    I was writing a book, and I was
                    keeping a diary. But the book and the

                    this life. I don't even know how to
                    think about it. I live in a palace.
                    But it's also a prison. I'm moving at
                    half the speed of light and I can't
                    go anywhere!
          Jim takes that in.

                    gear. There's a submarine down there,
                    can you believe it? Ships and
                    airplanes and bulldozers. That's what
                    I wanted, a world still being built.
                    But I'll never see it.
          They sit for a moment in glum contemplation.

          The deep RUMBLE is louder. A bloody light fills the sky.
          A STAR looms ahead of the ship: a RED GIANT. The Excelsior
          rockets toward the star.
          The passage takes less than a minute. The Red Giant swells in
          the windows. The ship shudders. The engines howl. Aurora
          falls into Jim's arms. The ship bathed in red light.
          The star fills the skylight, fills the sky itself. A fiery
          surface turbulent with sunspots and mysterious currents. The
          engines howl.
          And then they're past. The star recedes, dwindling as quickly
          as it grew. The engines quiet. The ship's calm restored.

          Aurora frowns, processing this sentence - her smile fading.

          Aurora stops breathing. She stares at the bartop.
          Jim strolls up to the bar. His hand slides into the jacket
          pocket where the ring lies hidden.
          But Aurora's body language is all wrong. He stops, perplexed.

          Jim's hand slides out of his jacket pocket. He shoots a look
          at Arthur, who smiles back, oblivious.
          Aurora's eyes bore into him. Finally Jim finds his voice.

                    across these two contacts, and then
                    these two. And cut these wires.

          Jim pulls a HAMMER from his belt and jams it crossways in the

          Jim dives inside. Skids to a stop beside Aurora. Pulls her
          loose from the column and shoves her toward the door,
          fighting the wind.
          Aurora scrambles through the doorway. Jim tries to follow -

          ORANGE FOAM blasts out, stiffening into a hard plastic. Jim

          Jim slides to a halt in front of a hibernation pod. Pulls a

          Aurora arrives on his heels. Watches as he works.

          shirt, a disheveled angel.

          Looks at Aurora in alarm. Reaches out, his hand spread flat
          on the glass.
          She reaches back, her hand matching his.
          The Captain's pod rises through the ceiling and vanishes. Jim

          An orange sun rises over green hills. In the foreground the
          roofs of Homestead II's capital city glow in the dawn.
          At the city's edge, timeworn spacecraft sit on their landing
          gear around a grassy landing field.
          Colonists gather. They watch the sky expectantly...
          A new star shines on the horizon.
          The star grows into a white starship gleaming in the sun. The
          Excelsior sweeps over the field with a rumble of engines.
          The ship's hull is scorched and abraded from its cosmic
          crossing. But the lights shine, the engines throb, the
          landing gear receive the weight of the ship.
          The starship's gangway lowers. The doors open.
          CHILDREN run down the gangway. Children of all ages, of all
          races. Twenty of them, thirty. They point at the sun, at the
          clouds, laughing, wide-eyed in wonder.
          We move up the gangway, through the disembarking passengers.
          Behind the children: Teenagers. Adults in smaller numbers as
          they grow older. Finally a handful of gray-haired elders.

          We move past vegetable gardens. Battered sweeper robots water
          the plantings. Window-washers till the soil.
          The OAK TREE towers a hundred feet tall over the Concourse.
          Its branches brush the skylight far above.
          We move past walls decorated with murals and carvings.
          At the Concourse Bar, Arthur is slicing vegetables. His
          timeworn uniform mended by hand.
          At the aft end of the Concourse, a high wall. Here a long

          landfall on Homestead II; the first, Jim's awakening. In
          between: an accelerating tally of births, deaths, marriages,
          catastrophes and achievements...a century of shipboard life.
          At the base of the wall we find a table like an altar, where
          a collection of artifacts is displayed:
          The meteor pried from the Excelsior's heart.
