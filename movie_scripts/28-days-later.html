          Images of stunning violence. Looped.
                         
          Soldiers in a foreign war shoot an unarmed civilian at point-
          blank range; a man is set on by a frenzied crowd wielding
          clubs and machetes; a woman is necklaced while her killers
          cheer and howl.
                         
          Pull back to reveal that we are seeing one of many screens in

          ...chimp, strapped to an operating table, with its skull
          dissected open, webbed in wires and monitoring devices,
          muzzled with a transparent guard. Alive.
                         
          Behind the surgical chamber, through the wide doorframe, we
          can see a larger laboratory beyond.

          A group of black-clad ALF Activists, all wearing balaclavas,
          move down a corridor. They carry various gear - bag, bolt
          cutters.
                         
          As they move, one Activist reaches up to a security camera
          and sprays it black with an aerosol paint can.

          The Chief Activist takes his camera off his shoulder and
          starts taking photos.
                         
          The room is huge and long, and darkened except for specific
          pools of light. Partially illuminated are rows of cages with
          clear perspex doors. They run down either side of the room.
          In the cages are chimpanzees.

          Most are in a state of rabid agitation, banging and clawing
          against the perspex, baring teeth through foam-flecked
          mouths.
                         
          They reach the far end of the lab, where on a huge steel
          operating table they see the dissected chimp.

</b>           Oh God...
                         
          The dissected chimp's eyes flick to the Activists. Blood
          wells from around the exposed brain tissue.
                         
          Tears starts to roll down the Female Activist's cheeks.

           going to get them out of here...
                         
          The Finnish Activist is checking the perspex cages.

          The Finnish Activist raises his crowbar and sticks it around
          the edge of one of the doors - about to prise it open.
                         
          At the moment, the doors to the laboratory bang open.
                         
          The Activists all turn. Standing at the entrance is the
          Scientist.
                         
          A pause. The Scientist jumps to a telephone handset on the
          wall and shouts into the receiver.

          The Chief Activist plucks the receiver from the Scientist's
          hands, and then rips the telephone from the wall.

          Like a bullet from a gun, the infected chimp leaps out at the
          Female Activist - and sinks its teeth into her neck. She
          reels back as the chimp claws and bites with extraordinary
          viciousness.
                         
          At the same moment, a deafening alarm begins to sound.

          The door to Jim's hospital room is locked. The key is on the
          floor. He picks it up and opens the door.
                         
          Jim exits into a corridor.
                         
          At the far end, a sign read: COMA WARD. There is no sign of
          life or movement.
                         
          Jim walks down the corridor. One of the doors is half-open.
          From inside, there is the sound of buzzing flies.

          Jim moves as quickly as he can through the hospital, still
          weak, but now driven by adrenaline.
                         
          All the wards and corridors are deserted. Medical notes and
          equipment lie strewn over the floors, trolleys are upended,
          glass partition doors are smashed. In a couple of places,
          splashes of dried blood arc up the walls.
                         
          He reaches A&amp;E. On one wall is a row of public pay phones.
                         
          He lifts a receiver, and the line is dead. He goes down the
          line, trying them all.
                         
          In the corner of the A&amp;E reception is a smashed soft-drinks
          machine, with a few cans collected at the base.
                         
          Jim grabs one, rips off the ring-pull and downs it in one go.
          Then he grabs another, and heads for the main doors.

          Jim exits and walks out into the bright daylight of the

          Aside from a quiet rush of wind, there is silence. No

          Jim walks through the empty city, from St. Thomas's Hospital,
          over Westminster Bridge, past the Houses of Parliament, down
          Whitehall, to Trafalgar Square.

          A bright overhead sun bleaches the streets. A light drifts
          litter and refuse. Cars lie abandoned, shops looted.
                         
          Jim is still wearing his hospital pyjamas, and carries a
          plastic bag full of soft-drink cans.

          rest...
                         
          He pauses. Down a narrow side street is a church. He walks
          towards it. The front doors are open.

          people adopt when entering a church.
                         
          The doors ahead to the main chamber are closed. Pushing them,
          gently trying the handle, it is obvious they are locked. But
          another open door is to his left. He goes through it.

          Jim moves up a stairwell.
                         
          Written large on the wall is a single line of graffiti:

          Jim moves into the gallery level, and sees, through the dust
          and rot, ornate but faded splendor. At the far end, a stained-
          glass window is illuminated by the moonlight.
                         
          Jim pads in, stands at the gallery, facing the stained-glass
          window for a moment before looking down...
                         
          Beneath are hundreds of dead bodies. Layered over the floor,
          jammed into the pews, spilling over the altar. The scene of
          an unimaginable massacre.
                         
          Jim stands, stunned. Then sees, standing motionless at
          different positions facing away from him, four people.
                         
          Their postures and stillness make their status unclear. Jim
          hesitates before speaking.

          Immediately, the four heads flick around. Infected.
                         
          And the next moment, there is the powerful thump of a door at
          the far end of the gallery.
                         
          Jim whirls to the source as the Infected below start to move.
                         
          The door thumps again - another stunningly powerful blow, the
          noise echoing around the chamber.
                         
          Confused, fist closing around his bag of soft drinks, Jim
          steps onto the gallery, facing the door...
                         
          ...and it smashes open.
                         
          Revealing an Infected Priest - who locks sight on Jim, and
          starts to sprint.

          And now the moonlight catches the Priest's face. Showing
          clearly: the eyes. The blood smeared and collected around his
          nose, ears, and mouth. Darkened and crusted, accumulated over
          days and weeks. Fresh blood glistening.

          In a movement of pure instinct, Jim swings the bag just as
          the Priest is about to reach him - and connects squarely with
          the man's head.

          As he reaches the bottom the doors are broken open, and the
          Infected give chase.

          A hand fires up a Zippo lighter, and lights the rag of a
          Molotov cocktail.
                         
          As Jim runs, something flies past his head, and the Infected
          closest to him explodes in a ball of flame.

          engulfing two in the fireball.

          ...Selena, a black woman, also in her twenties. She wears a
          small backpack, a machete is stuck into her belt - and she

          Surprisingly, everything is neat and tidy. Washed plates are
          stacked by the sink, newspapers on the table are neatly
          piled. The headline on the top paper reads simply:

          They reach the bottom of the stairs. Selena gestures upwards,
          and Jim nods. They start to ascend.
                         
          At the top of the stairs, Selena sniffs the air, and recoils.
          Jim has noticed it too. His eyes widen in alarm.

          But Jim pushes past and advances along the top landing, until
          he reaches a door. By now the smell is so bad that he is
          having to cover his nose and mouth with the sleeve of one
          arm.
                         
          Jim pushes open the door. Inside, two decomposed bodies lie
          side by side on the bed, intertwined. On the bedside table
          are an empty bottle of sleeping pills and a bottle of red
          wine.
                         
          Mark appears behind him. Jim stares at his parents for a
          couple of moments, then Mark closes the door.

          Jim, Selena and Mark sit in the living room, on the two
          sofas. Jim looks dazed, uncomprehending. Selena watches Jim,
          her expression neutral.

           Hoping: maybe we could get to
           Heathrow, maybe buy our way on a
           plane. My dad had all this cash,
           even though cash was already
           useless, and Mum had her jewellery.
           But twenty thousand other people

           my grip on my sister's hand. I
           remember realizing the ground was

           standing on people. Like a carpet,
           people who had fallen, and...
           somewhere in the crowd there were
           infected. It spread fast, no one
           could run, all you could do was
           climb. Over more people. So I did
           that. I got up, somehow, on top of
           a kiosk.

          framed. Above the counter, on a shelf of cookery books, an

          Through the kitchen window, a second silhouette appears.
                         
          Then there is a scratching noise from the back door.
                         
          Jim freezes.

          A beat - then the door is abruptly and powerfully smashed in.
          It flies open, and hangs loosely held by the bottom hinge.
          Standing in the doorframe is an Infected Man.
                         
          Jim shouts with alarm as the Man lunges at him - and they
          both go tumbling to the floor. At the same moment, the figure
          behind the kitchen window smashes the glass, and an Infected
          Teenage Girl starts to clamber through the jagged frame.
                         
          The Man gets on top of Jim, while Jim uses his arms to hold
          back the ferocious assault. A single strand of saliva flies
          from the Man's lips, and contacts Jim's cheek.

          Suddenly, Selena is there, holding her machete. The blade
          flashes down to the back of the Man's neck. Blood gushes.
                         
          Jim rolls the Infected Man off, just in time to see...
                         
          ...Mark dispatch the Girl half way through the kitchen
          window. The Girl is holding Mark, but her legs are caught on
          the broken glass.
                         
          Mark jabs upwards into the Girl's torso - she stiffens, then
          slumps, and as Mark steps back we see he is holding a knife.
                         
          Jim hyperventilates, staring at the corpse on the kitchen
          floor.

          Jim turns to Mark. He is standing in the middle of the room.
          Stepped away from the window. The Girl's blood is on his arm -
          and he is wiping it away...
                         
          ...off the skin... where a long scratch cut wells up fresh

          But Selena is swiping with her machete. Mark lifts his arm
          instinctively, defensively, and the blade sinks in.
                         
          Selena immediately yanks it back.

          side of the head. Mark falls.

          them, as Selena brutally finishes Mark off.
                         
          Selena looks at Mark's body for a couple of beats, then
          lowers the blade. She picks up a dishcloth from the sink
          counter and tosses it to Jim.

          Infected's blood from around his neck.

          A line of tower blocks some distance away, standing against
          the night sky. In one of them, hanging in the window of one
          of the highest stories, colored fairy lights are lit up,
          blinking gently.

          Jim and Selena walk through the smashed glass doors of the
          tower block. It is extremely dark inside.
                         
          Selena switches on a flashlight and illuminates the entrance
          hall. It is a mess. The floor is covered in broken glass and
          dried blood. The lift doors are jammed open, and inside is a
          dense bundle of rags - perhaps an old corpse, but impossible
          to tell, because the interior of the lift has been torched.
          It is black with carbon, and smoke-scarring runs up the
          outside wall.
                         
          Selena moves the flashlight to the stairwell. There is a huge
          tangle of shopping trolleys running up the stairs.
                         
          Selena gives one of the trolleys an exploratory tug. It
          shifts, but holds fast, meshed in with its neighbor. Then she
          puts a foot into one of the grates, and lifts herself up.
          Shining her light over the top of the tangle, she can see a
          gap along the top.

          Jim and Selena move steadily and quietly up the stairwell,
          into the building. Reaching a next landing, they check around
          the corner before proceeding. Through a broken window, we can
          see that they are already high above most London buildings,
          and on the wall a sign reads: LEVEL 5.

          down the building. Jim and Selena both make a grab for their

          The scream comes again. The noise is chilling, echoing up the
          empty stairwell.
                         
          But there is something strange about it. The noise is human,
          but oddly autistic. It is held for slightly too long, and
          stops abruptly.

          an amazing burst of energy and speed.
                         
          They round another bend in the stairwell...
                         
          ...then both Jim and Selena scream. Standing directly in
          front of them is a Man In Riot Cop Gear - helmet with full
          visor, gloves, a riot shield in one hand, and a length of
          lead pipe in the other.
                         
          The Man lunges past both of them, barging past, where the
          Infected White Man has appeared at the stairwell.
                         
          The Riot Gear Man swings his lead pipe and connects viciously
          with the White Man's head. The White Man falls backwards
          against the Asian Man. Both fall back down the stairs.
                         
          The Riot Gear Man turns back to Jim and Selena.

          The Asian Man is coming back up the stairs. Jim looks back

          Jim looks back down the corridor.
                         
          At the far end, the Man appears. He is holding the limp body

          Jim and Selena enter past the pale-faced girl. The flat is
          council, three-bed, sixteenth floor of the block. It has
          patterned wallpaper, and nice but boring furnishings. It is
          lit by candles.
                         
          The entrance hall leads straight to the living room, which
          has French windows and a small balcony outside.
                         
          On one wall, a framed photograph hangs, which shows the Man
          standing beside a black taxi cab. Next to him is a middle
          aged woman - presumably the Man's wife. Hannah sits at the
          cab's steering wheel, beaming.

          In the living room, the fairy lights hang in the window,
          powered by a car battery. Lit by their glow, the Man goes
          through a careful ritual of shedding his gear, helped by
          Hannah.
                         
          First, he lays down the riot shield. Then he puts the
          bloodsmeared lead pipe on a small white towel. Next, he
          removes his gloves - and places them beside the bar on the
          towel. Then he folds the towel over the weapon and gloves,
          and puts it beside the riot shield. Finally he removes the
          visored helmet.
                         
          Jim and Selena watch him. They look pretty rattled, not
          really knowing what to expect.
                         
          After the Man has finished shedding his gear, he turns.

          He extends his hand to Jim and Selena. Jim hesitates very
          briefly, then shakes it.

          Frank beams, and suddenly he seems much less frightening and
          imposing. If anything, he is just as nervous as Jim and
          Selena.

          the blood.
                         
          Then, from outside, Frank speaks.

          London is spectacular - low clouds catching the sunrise, and
          a plume of smoke still drifting up from the petrol station
          blaze. But more noticeable is that the entire roof area is

          The Driver flips Jim the finger, and accelerates away.
                         
          Jim remains stopped by the pavement, one foot down for
          balance, breathing hard. Pedestrians pass. Groups of people,
          everyday people, walking by.
                         
          Jim watches them, noticing their faces. Some talk to each
          other, or into mobile phones. Some smile, or walk lost in
          thought.
                         
          After a few moments, Jim sets off again, seemingly
          distracted, still watching pedestrians' faces...then two of
          the faces seem to catch his attention. A man and a woman,
          middle-aged, chatting.
                         
          His parents.
                         
          Jim's head turns as he passes them, confusion on his face,
          his bike drifting into another lane...
                         
          ...into the path of a second car. The car that hit him.

          Fifty meters down, the road is blockaded. It is obviously a
          military construction - hurriedly put together, but expertly
          built.
                         
          Behind rolls of razor wire are fifteen foot sheets of
          corrugated iron, held upright by scaffold pipes. In the
          middle of the blockade there is a gap wide enough to get a
          vehicle through, but concrete blocks force a chicane.

          On either side of the road there are sandbag nests. On the
          corrugated iron, white painted words read: 42ND BLOCKADE. But
          despite the impressive construction, there is no sign of
          movement or life.

          The cab rolls slowly towards the blockade - past many more
          bodies, Infected, rotting.
                         
          It reaches the chicane, and eases around the concrete blocks.
          Then it passes through the gap in the corrugated barrier. On
          the other side of the blockade, canvas tents have been
          erected on the grass verge, and two transporter trucks are
          parked. A few packing crates and tarpaulins are also
          scattered around. But still no signs of life. The blockade
          appears to have been abandoned.

          Cautiously, they begin to explore. They first head over to

          Hannah picks up a Bergen backpack. She upends it, and a few
          clothes fall out.
                         
          Frank moves past her, and carefully pulls back the tent flaps
          - machete at the ready. Inside, there is a small table, and

          His head sinks, staring at the ground beneath his legs. A
          couple of moments later he looks up - and sees that sitting
          opposite of him, on the other side of the archway, almost
          mirroring his posture and position, is a dead Infected.
                         
          The corpse of the Infected sits gazing back at Frank with
          sightless eyes.
                         
          A moment between the two of them. A blank-faced exchange.
                         
          Frank looks left and sees the corpse of another Infected, a
          few feet beyond the blockade. And another, beyond it. And
          another, a few more feet to the right.
                         
          Then Frank looks upwards. Above him, on the walkway of the
          blockade, another corpse lies. And this corpse is swarmed
          with crows, picking at it.

          Down... to where Frank gazes upwards.
                         
          The droplet splashes, pinpoint perfect, on Frank's eye.
                         
          Frank frowns, his hand immediately going to his face. The
          fingers come away, with the tiny smear of red.

          And at that moment there is a rifle report, a rush of air,

          A jeep drives down a small road - away from the blockade.
          Jim, Selena and Hannah sit in the back. Behind is the cab,
          driven by the Sergeant. A little way ahead of them, the
          walled grounds of a huge country mansion appear.

          From a cast-iron gated entrance, a gravel driveway leads up
          to the impressive country mansion, surrounded by a high
          perimeter wall. The grounds show acres of lawn and flower
          beds. These have obviously had many years of very careful
          cultivation and attention, but now are just starting to look
          unkempt and overgrown.
                         
          The jeep pulls up by the front steps. Waiting there is
          another soldier, a major. Like the other soldiers, he is
          unshaven, but has the authority of command about him, even in
          the relaxed way that he stands.
                         
          As Jim, Selena and Hannah dismount from the jeep, he
          appraises them. Then speaks.

           up against a wall)
           Easy, tiger. You don't want to go
           picking a fight with me.
                         
          Suddenly Farrell is behind Mitchell. We see a movement (a
          kidney punch), and Mitchell drops.

          Then - as if through sixth sense, sensing a presence, all
          turn. Henry is standing in the doorway.
                         
          A moment. Then Henry turns to Mitchell - who has picked
          himself up, and is clutching his side, breathing hard.

          The soldiers exit, leaving only Jim, Henry and Selena in the
          room.
                         
          Selena is shaken, and won't meet Jim's eyes.
                         
          Henry hands Selena her machete back.

          Selena takes the machete and exits, but Jim doesn't follow.
          Obviously there is something he wants to say to Henry.

          an explosion of gunfire. Jones has fired and killed Farrell.
                         
          As Farrell drops, the enraged Mitchell turns on Jones.

          From the side of the clearing, in the trees, there is the
          sound of sudden movement.

          Both men immediately set off, diving back into the foliage...
                         
          A beat passes. Then, in the pile of bodies, one of them sits
          up...

          Mitchell and Jones move fast, scanning, pushing through the
          undergrowth. Mitchell is absolutely furious. And as they run,
          they startle a couple of birds, which fly up from the ground,
          making a suspiciously familiar noise...

          path of the ivy upwards, to the coiled razor wire, where a
          scrap of torn and bloody clothing hangs.

          He is out of breath, frightened, jumping at every sound.
                         
          Then he trips, rolls down a short slope, and when he comes to

          attracted by noise of the heavy machine gun, are approaching.
                         
          He looses off a couple of shots at the Infected, then starts
          to back away to the jeep.

          Henry runs up to the jeep. Through the rain, and the water
          running down the windscreen, Henry can see a figure sitting
          at the driver's seat.

          But there is no one there.
                         
          Henry shoots again, blindly, emptying his clip at anything
          and everything around him.
                         
          He reloads - hurriedly, hands slipping on the wet clip,
          betraying nervousness...
                         
          ...and fires at a rain shadow that sweeps between two of the

          even turn over.
                         
          Reaching under the dashboard, he pulls out a handful of

          And at the moment, an Infected slams onto the windscreen,
          face against the glass.
                         
          Henry shouts out of surprise and anger, lifting his gun, and
          fires at point-blank range, through the glass, into the
          Infected's face.
                         
          The windscreen shatters, blown outwards.
                         
          And now, where our view was obscured by rain-washed glass, we

          Pull back, to see: Jones has run straight into Jim's bayonet.
                         
          Jones falls, taking the gun and bayonet with him.

          Jones is lying flat on his back, mortally wounded, gazing up.
          Still alive - but only just. Taking his very last breaths.
                         
          Henry kneels beside him, and Jones's eyes turn to his
          officer. He blinks, tries to speak, but is too weak and close
          to death to form the words.
                         
          Henry's hand closes around Jones.

          With incredible viciousness, the power and savagery of the

          Hannah floors the accelerator.
                         
          But instead of going forward, the cab reverses.

          The cab reverses fast, then Hannah slams the brakes. The cab
          slides to a halt.
                         
          An Infected slams against Henry's window.
                         
          At that moment, the back windscreen smashes.
                         
          The hands of the Infected grab hold of Henry's head.
                         
          Hannah watches, turned around in the seat.
                         
          Henry scream - and we see it's Mailer's face behind him.
                         
          Hannah floors the accelerator again, but this time in forward
          gear. Henry is sucked out of the back window.

          The cab screeches up to Jim and Selena.
                         
          Selena bundles Jim in, and the cab is off in a spray of
          gravel...

          As Henry is killed by Mailer, the silhouettes of the Infected
          appear in the shadows.
                         
                         
<b>          INT. CAB - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN

          The cab races towards the cast-iron front gates of the
          mansion - and we see they are locked with a chain and
          padlock.

          Hannah reaches and buckles her seat belt. Jim and Selena
          brace for impact...
                         
          They hit the gates, hard. Jim and Selena fly towards the

          Freeze. Held.

          Waking from a nightmare, Jim's eyes snap open with a sharp
          intake of breath.
                         
          An echo of when we first saw him lying in the hospital. But
          this time, when we pull away, we see he is lying on a double
          bed, in the bedroom of a small farmhouse.
                         
          Alone. But Selena's clothes are scattered.
                         
          Jim rises.
                         
          He looks around. Bright daylight is flooding into the room
          through the window.

          Jim walks down the stairs and peers into a living room -
          where he sees the sofa, with its cover removed.

          He picks up a length of red material. Once part of the dress.

          A Lakeland valley, with a single farmhouse, and the black cab
          parked outside.
                         
          Also outside is Hannah, who is arranging huge lengths of
          material on the grass.
                         
          From our ground-level angle, there is no sense to be made of
          what Hannah is doing.
                         
          And we keep pulling back...

          ...fast, down the valley, along a single ribbon of road.
                         
          Past a sign: Langdale Valley...
                         
          Further, now over a mile distant from the farmhouse, then:
                         
          Stopping, abruptly.
                         
          At a single Infected, who sits, emaciated, in the middle of
          the road.
                         
          A quiet moment with the starving emaciated Infected. It is so
          weak it can hardly move. Only blink.
                         
          Then, in the background, a distant rush of noise, the low
          roar of a jet engine.
                         
          Slowly, the Infected turns its head upwards, where, in the
          clear blue sky, it sees:
                         
          A vapor trail.
                         
          A plane.

          and the farmhouse.
                         
          Where, outside, we now make sense of the stitched sheets and
          curtains, as they form letters on the grass below:
                         
<b>                          HELL

          ...screaming towards them, flying low along the valley floor,
          comes a jet plane.
                         
          They stand transfixed as the plane races towards them.
                         
          As it passes over, flying directly overhead, the terrific
          wash of air and noises whips around them, connected with a
          colossal sonic boom...
                         
          The boom rolls away, and the plane has passed...
                         
          Around Jim, Selena and Hannah, the sheets and material of the
          letters, ripped into the air, now spiral to the ground,
          falling around them.
