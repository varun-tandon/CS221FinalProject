<b>          INT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - VERY EARLY MORNING
</b>                         
          MARK SCHULTZ (27, 180 lbs., cauliflower ears) lifts a human-
          sized, leather WRESTLING DUMMY from the mat to stand in front
          of him. He performs a series of repetitive moves - hooking
          one arm under the dummy's arm, then the other; one side, then
          other. Again and again. It looks almost as if he's dancing
          gently with it.
                         
          Then, very fast, Mark spins quickly around behind the dummy,
          grabs it in a bear hug, arches his back, lifts and SLAMS it
          to the mat, landing on top.
                         
          QUICK CUTS: Mark spinning, lifting and slamming the dummy -
          first one way, then the other - first one hold, then another -
          SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM - over and over and over again.

          this nondescript, 1960s-era suburban brick-facade school.
          He's freshly showered, wears a short-sleeve dress shirt, clip-

          out a battered BROWN VINYL BRIEFCASE.

          The students are open-mouthed - they have no idea what to
          make of him. Mark's not being willfully over-the-top with

           my best friend, my older brother,
           my best friend - won one too, just
           23 hours and 16 minutes before I
           did. That's unprecedented - two

          splayed on the mat, fending him off.

          Mark RUNS hard through the woods - pushing himself - jumping
          fallen branches, sprinting up hills. He reaches the edge of

<b>                          DU PONT

          Silence. Du Pont goes over to him, unsure what to do.
          Uncomfortable, he puts his hand on Mark's shoulder.

          Mark's body starts to shake. Then, very quietly:

          This is the first time anyone has said anything like this to
          du Pont. He has no idea how to respond. He woodenly pats
          Mark's shoulder, then takes his hand back.

          Mark and Nanev wrestle the final seconds - Mark ahead by a
          point. Nanev tries desperately to turn Mark, to gain any
          advantage. The whistle blows.
                         
          The ref takes each of their hands. He RAISES Mark's. He turns
          them around, raises Mark's hand again.
                         
          Mark does a BACK FLIP. He trots over to the opposing coach,
          shakes his hand. He trots to his corner where Dave - beaming,
          his arms open wide - embraces him. Mark hugs his brother
          quickly, then turns to LOOK OUT into the stands.
                         
          He SPOTS du Pont, who's coming down the steps toward the
          platform. Mark walks toward him. The enormity of what he's
          just accomplished STARTS TO HIT Mark. His face is red. He
          reaches du Pont, and from a step below him, THROWS HIS ARMS
          around him, clings to him. Mark starts to SOB.
                         
          Du Pont holds him as he looks out toward the wrestling mat,
          where Dave watches.

           The gold medal Mark won in 1984 was
           tarnished. Tarnished by Jimmy
           Carter. Tarnished by the

           entire Eastern bloc to boycott our

           an opportunity to shine up that
           medal at the World Championships in

          Mark kneels on the mat with du Pont, holding him in the
          starting position. Mark is talking du Pont through the moves
          for an escape.

          Du Pont stands up. Expressionless, he disappears through the
          sliding glass doors into the house. Mark LOOKS OUT over the
          dark grounds of Foxcatcher. Quiet.

          when it accidentally goes off, firing a few bullets into the
          wood deck - though he doesn't seem to notice.

          An exhausted du Pont, in his Foxcatcher singlet, is slumped
          in his chair, encouraging Mark to massage his shoulders. Mark

          of an early ULTIMATE FIGHTING MATCH. It's an American street
          fighter versus a huge Brazilian Jujutsu expert. The match is

          Mark PEDALS furiously on a STATIONARY BIKE, wearing five
          layers of sweats and fleeces with PLASTICS on top. We can see
          how much Mark is perspiring by the POOLS OF SWEAT which are
          collecting up his arms. Dave eggs him on as he shoves TINY
          PIECES of ICE up Mark's nose to keep him from overheating.

          We SEE their conversation from Mark's POV (we'll hear only
          pieces of it): Dave explains how Mark needs to be left alone.
          Du Pont resists at first; Dave is gentle but firm. He tells
          du Pont he shouldn't be in Mark's corner right now.
                         
          Finally, du Pont turns and WALKS OUT. Dave turns back toward
          Mark. Mark puts his head down and PEDALS even harder.

          The official looks at them, OPENS his log book. Dave helps
          Mark peel off his sweats. Soaked, they hit the floor with a
          smack. Mark, in his singlet, gets on the scale.
                         
          He's 30 GRAMS OVERWEIGHT (5 ounces). He steps off, and Dave

          THE TAPE ENDS. The TV screen goes to static snow.
                         
          SILENCE. Du Pont sits there, Director next to him. Finally,
          du Pont stands and starts for the door. Director follows.

           course, but there was also an open
           afternoon half-hour, directly after
           "The Edge of Night." That should be
           a good one -
                         
          Du Pont continues right out the door, down the hallway, not
          even turning to face him.

          The Director stops at the door. He calls out to du Pont --

          Du Pont walks out a SIDE DOOR of the Big House, followed by
          the LARGE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD.
                         
          He continues toward his car - the BLACK MERCURY - goes to the
          driver's side. Then, something catches his eye in a nearby
          tree - he points it out the Security Guard:

          They get in the car and du Pont turns on the ignition. Before
          he shifts into gear, he removes the PISTOL from his waistband
          and places it on the middle seat. He pulls out.

          Du Pont drives the dirt road that edges the woods ringing the
          enormous front lawn. The trees are bare, a bit snowy.
          Peaceful and pretty. The car approaches Dave's house.

          Du Pont's car pulls up. Dave's Subaru is parked in the yard
          out front, and Dave lies half-in-half-out the driver's side
          door, working on the FUSE BOX under the steering column.
                         
          Dave rises out of the car to see who's pulled up.

</b>           Hey, Coach.
                         
          Dave takes a step toward du Pont's car. Du Pont just looks at
          him through his open driver's window.

          Du Pont picks up his PISTOL from the seat.

          Du Pont SHOOTS Dave. The bullet goes through Dave's hand,
          smashing into his chest, throwing him to the ground.
                         
          The Security Guard scrambles out the car door and ducks
          behind the passenger side fender.
                         
          Dave tries to crawl away.

          Du Pont POINTS the pistol at her. She RUNS inside.
                         
          Du Pont SHOOTS Dave in the back. Then he SHOOTS him in the
          back of the head.
                         
          After a few moments, he drives away.
                         
          Nancy runs outside. She cradles her husband as he bleeds out
          in the snow.

          He's in front of a painted cinder block wall. He wears only
          shorts, no shirt. A CLOCK ticks on the wall behind him.
                         
          After several moments, we START TO HEAR crowd-pumping MUSIC

          loud, crowd-pumping music. Strobe lights. Mark's bare-
