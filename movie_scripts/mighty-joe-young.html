    The lush Pangani Mountains of Africa, mysterious and
    seemingly untouched.

    A warm golden light bathes the jungle. Shafts of
    sunlight filter through the forest floor. The sounds of
    WILD BIRDS break the hushed quiet of the setting. As we
    MOVE IN we FIND a large female mountain gorilla lounging,
    eating leaves in the dense undergrowth, her precocious
    baby gorilla plays nearby.


<b>    THROUGH CAMERA LENS
</b>
    A view of the mother gorilla, a few PICTURES SNAPPED.


<b>    BACK TO SCENE
</b>
    The photographer is RUTH YOUNG, naturalist, researcher,
    sitting in the undergrowth with her camera, notebooks,
    and sketch pad. Her precocious young daughter, JILL,
    plays nearby.

    Jill smiles, watching the baby gorilla clown. As the baby
    sees her, he suddenly scampers to a nearby tree and hides
    his face behind it. Jill does the same. She peeks out to
    catch a glimpse, just as the baby peeks out to catch her
    eye. They both scamper to different trees. Each time
    they move to a different tree, they go through this
    peek-a-boo interaction, both moving further away from
    their mothers. The mother GORILLA notices, lets out a
    CRY. Ruth looks around for Jill and signals by a
    distinctive whistle for her to come back this instant.

    Both children take a last look at each other and then
    scurry to their waiting mothers.

</b>              Jill.   What did I tell you?

</b>              But Joe started it!

              with us.
                      (gathering her things)
              Besides, that wasn't Joe. It was

    Jill helps her mother heft the equipment as they start to
    head back to camp.

<b>                                 JILL
</b>                 No it wasn't.    It was Joe.

<b>                               RUTH
</b>                 Joe is just a baby, Jill.      He was
                 too big to be Joe.

    As they walk, they can see the sunset over the mountain
    trail.

    confidence in her voice.

    riding right with us. Something is moving quickly up

    Bursting THROUGH FRAME -- a pack of mongrel hunting dogs
    driven hard by a half dozen African men with rifles.

    Poachers wielding pangas (machetes). A glint of silver
    as a panga sweeps ACROSS FRAME, hacking at the wall of
    thistles and nettles.

    Eyes yellow. Teeth flared. The RINGING sound made by

    PUNCH IN to reveal -- impaled in the earth, a three-foot
    stick figure with a macabre animal skull for a head. The
    poacher shouts in local dialect until -- A foul-looking
    man, GARTH, pushes INTO FRAME. Carrying a heavy Weatherby
    Mark V rifle across his back. Garth yanks the primitive
    doll from the ground. Looks back as -- A figure
    approaches in the darkness.

    A glowing cigar clenched in his stained teeth, STRASSER
    checks the doll over -- primitive, grotesque; then snaps
    it in two. Tossing it away contemptuously, he shouts
    orders in the local dialect.

    The men continue up the path. Dogs sweeping behind like
    a wildfire. CLANG-CLANG-CLANG. PAN UP OVER TO --

    sits on the edge of a cot, tucking Jill into bed.   She

                 months old. Either I got
                 confused, or he's a very unusual
                 gorilla.

</b>                 Yes, you did. And Mommy's going
                 to write it down in her book.

    She holds up a dog-eared composition book, Ruth's detailed
    log of her observations.

    Jill smiles.

<b>                               RUTH
</b>                 Now go to sleep.

                 Your song and my song. It goes on
                 forever.'

    As she sings, a man appears in the doorway. This is
    KWELI, the camp manager. He seems nervous and impatient,
    but doesn't want to disturb Ruth. Jill sees him.

    the hut, she grabs her walking stick.

    Ruth exits, Kweli behind her. Jill follows, despite her
    mother's orders... but Kweli feels her behind him. He
    turns around and crouches down, looking Jill seriously in
    the face:

    A group of Bahatu trackers have gathered in the center of
    the camp. They stand, silently, listening...

    The distant CHIMING of the poaching dogs is unmistakable --
    ECHOING in the night.

    Ruth walks into the circle, also listening.      She turns to
    Kweli.

    Ruth leads them onto the forest path that goes up the
    mountain.

    Jill has not stayed in bed.       She has come out of the hut
    to watch the commotion.

    Her mother, silhouetted by moonlight, in her mind larger-
    than-life, pushes up the trail. Then she's gone.

     Strasser leads a breakneck pace through the woods. Garth
     looks around as the AFRICANS begin to murmur something over

               And it's staring them right in the

     The men stare back at Strasser with equal hostility.

     Suddenly, Garth kneels and picks something from the
     ground. Rubs it between his fingers. Deposits it in
     Strasser's hand.

     Jill is pacing by the hut, trying to stay put like her

     Trees shake furiously.

     Strasser spins to see several gorillas, darting from the
     trees, a blur of black shapes trying to escape up the
     mountain.


<b>     CLOSE ON ONE FEMALE
</b>
     The same one Ruth watched earlier. Joe clings tightly
     to her back, his eyes wide with fear.


<b>     JOE'S POV

     A nightmarish collage of images accompanied by the
     CLANGING of the dogs' COLLARS, the charge of the African
     poachers, the SCREAMS of the MOTHER and the other
     GORILLAS. Then he sees Strasser run forward, raise his
     rifle with icy precision.


<b>     THROUGH SCOPE

     Strasser has Joe's mother dead on. Her head in the
     cross-hairs as she tries to get away. The MOTHER'S raspy
     animal SCREAM is unmistakably maternal, heart-breaking.
     It ECHOES across the mountain as she tries to reach a
     deep stretch of woods.

     On her back, Joe turns once more to look back and sees --

     THROUGH the tall grass in the b.g., he can see the
     Africans disappear up the hill hunting down the others.


<b>     BACK TO SCENE
</b>
     And then we see Joe's anguish turn to fury. He GROWLS --
     and as the two big hunters come nearer -- Joe springs out
     at them.

     Joe is moving so fast, Strasser barely has time to react
     before the furry black shape is on top of him -- WIDEN
     as Joe attacks Strasser, knocking him back. Strasser
     shouts and drops his rifle. Tries to pull Joe off as
     they tumble down through the trees. Strasser punches
     and pulls at this ball of sinew and muscle. He reaches
     for his Match Master side arm with his right hand. PUNCH
     IN CLOSE as Joe bites down viciously through the hand.
     Strasser howls...

     trees and flashes past Strasser, snatching Joe away. Joe
     is not quite sure what has happened, but he hangs on to
     Ruth for dear life.

     Strasser staggers forward, holding his mangled hand.
     Enraged.

     He rips Garth's gun away from him and with his bloodied
     hand, finds a way to pull the trigger. SHOTS RIP through
     BARK but Ruth disappears into the trees like a spirit.

     Jill shines her flashlight into the forest. Further up,
     someone waves a light back and forth. Like a signal.

     Jill's face lights up. She continues running. Suddenly,
     Jill is bowled over by Joe who leaps into her arms. They
     roll on the ground, Jill with the wind knocked out of her.
     They look into each other's face and both know that the
     worst is happening. They are both silent with fear.

     Strasser appears through the darkness. His right hand
     wrapped in a bloody swath. Denying the pain. Garth
     follows, gun up.

     Jill and Joe lie hiding in the undergrowth. Jill's eyes
     tell Joe not to make a sound. They barely breathe.

     Gregg puts his hand up to signal for quiet.

     He hears something.

     He listens intently for a moment, then the WHOOSH of a
     SPRING TRAP BLASTS his ears, followed by shouts and the
     sound of an ANIMAL SCREECHING. Gregg throws off the
     headphones, grabs a strange-looking pole called a DNA
     plug gun, and crashes with Pindi through the woods.

     Gregg runs INTO FRAME to see several of Pindi's men
     closing the cage on a lithe, young leopard.

     Pindi is on the verge of panic.       He forces his trademark

<b>     POV - TREES

     The top branches suddenly shake violently -- sending a
     sharp WOODEN RATTLE across the meadow. Is that a shadow
     from a passing cloud that seems to ripple through the
     foliage? Gregg steps closer. The trees bend like the
     wake of a boat -- they bend in a straight line.

     Something powerful and unseen is moving through the
     trees.

     Pindi and his men retreat back in the meadow. Gregg
     scans the forest. BRANCHES spring with a LOUD WHOOSH!

     Gregg can't help it -- his fear takes over and he
     backsteps into the meadow.

     WIDEN SHOT UP TO the trees. Catapulting DOWN THROUGH
     FRAME -- landing right in front of them is a gorilla --
     nearly 15 feet high. The GROUND TREMBLES from the force.

     A nearby Land Rover bounces two feet into the air from the
     impact.

     His canines are fully exposed. Thick, black hair on his
     crest stand erect. Deep brown eyes aglow as he gives
     another DEAFENING CALL. This is JOE. Backlit by the sun
     he seems to encompass the forest.

      Pindi scurries for cover behind the frozen, awe-
      stricken trackers.


<b>      ANGLE - JOE
</b>
      moves to the cage and peers inside. The LEOPARD paces and
      HISSES. Joe straightens up bi-pedally and pounds his
      massive chest with his fist. The hollow POK-POK-POK ECHOES
      off the mountain.

      Joe raises his hand again and smashes the top off the
      cage, as if it were made of matchsticks. The leopard
      leaps out of the cage and dashes safely into the forest.
      JOE bares his teeth and ROARS at Gregg, as if to say
      "stay off my mountain." His mission accomplished, Joe
      quickly turns and starts back for tree cover.

      Silence. Everyone is open-mouthed, unable to believe
      what they have just seen...

      Then Greg snaps out of it. Bursting into action, he runs
      to the humvee, motions to Pindi.

     The caravan, looking like the cavalry in a Western, comes
     charging over the hill.

     Gregg's humvee comes crashing over a ridge in pursuit of
     Joe. Gregg yells out to the cars around him:

     way to avoid colliding with Joe.

     FOLLOW JOE as he books across the meadow in the opposite
     direction, now. The modified Land Rover with the hot
     seat attached to the hood swerves around and chases Joe.
     They catch up, and the tracker climbs into the hot seat,
     readying a metal clamp attached to a chain...

     Joe has just emerged from the tree stand, dragging the
     thoroughly-battered, modified Land Rover and its dazed
     occupants. Joe sees the humvee heading towards him.

     His brow furrows. Is he coming up with a plan?     He makes
     a ninety degree turn...

     Pindi looks forward again just in time to see...


<b>     THE CHAIN
</b>
     Pulled taut between Joe and the modified Land Rover, has
     become a moving clothesline, and the humvee is heading
     right into its path. Pindi tries to swerve, but they
     can't avoid it. He ducks and...

     Gregg leaps out of the car, hurdling the chain, just as...

     It shears the top right off the vehicle!

     Gregg tumbles to the ground, as the humvee rolls to a stop
     nearby. Meanwhile, the --

     is SPINNING OUT, still connected to Joe. Joe is almost
     curious about the chain. He begins to pull back as the

     in fact, the entire axle of the modified Land Rover, are
     pulled from their moorings.

     The tracker racks up against a tree, followed closely by
     his chair and winch...

     The axle tumbles to a stop...

     The LAND ROVER COLLAPSES like a stack of cards.

</b>
     stands at the edge of the field, observing his victory.
     Then he beats his chest and ROARS.


<b>     IN MEADOW
</b>
     Pindi and his men run to the one remaining car, the
     flatbed lorry. They all pile in and speed away across
     the field. Pindi sees something up ahead, yells at the
     driver.

     stumbling towards them.

     Pindi watches as Gregg stumbles around to the back of the
     truck. But instead of getting in, he grabs a silver case
     and pulls it off.

</b>                  Excuse me, boss, but please, I
                  would like to avoid being killed.

     Gregg flips opens the case, revealing a video camera.      He
     hoists it up, and barely able to walk, takes one last
     look at Pindi and the bruised and busted-up trackers.

     Gregg climbs over a fallen tree. Ducks under some low

     intently. Takes another step forward. Hears a TWIG

<b>     THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA

     PAN RIGHT. Joe springs out from hiding -- as gorillas
     love to do to enemies. He charges Gregg and cuffs him
     onto his back. Joe is in full attack mode -- eyes wide,
     teeth exposed. He snatches Gregg by the foot.


<b>     GREGG
</b>
     screams as he's jerked helplessly into the air. Joe
     shakes Gregg viciously -- then whips him back and forth,
     knocking him against a sapling. Gregg fights to free
     himself but he's no match for Joe's strength. He knows
     Joe is going to hurt him badly -- maybe kill him.

     Joe cocks his arm -- to crush Gregg against a wide tree

</b>                  What could I tell him? He knows
                  what he saw. He's not a fool.

     Jill and Gregg are still holding each other's eyes.

</b>                  I'll be the judge of that.

     Across the street, Gregg is breaking into a big, slow
     smile. It unnerves Jill. Kweli, always Jill's
     protector, catches the action between the two of them and
     bristles a bit -- but Jill has already turned her back
     and taken off through the back of the market.

     She hikes through the forest effortlessly, as though it
     were her own back yard.

     As she walks near the banks of a river, however, she
     stops. She listens carefully, sensing something out
     there, in the jungle.

     Gregg, his video camera in one hand, stands stock still
     behind a tree, trying to avoid being discovered. He is
     absolutely drenched in sweat, the long hike clearly much

     Still listening. All she can hear are the familiar

     it off and keeps moving.

     Jill comes out into a clearing, bordered by a large pool
     at the base of a magnificent waterfall. She pulls a
     flashlight out of her back pack and, in the same motion
     her mother used to summon her, begins waving it back and
     forth into the surrounding forest.

     watches this bizarre ritual, wondering what Jill could

     The thunderous sound making him nervous...

     Not so Jill. She waits calmly, at first, as the FOOT-
     STEPS APPROACH. Then, as the branches begin to bend and
     break, and we get our first glimpse of fur, she smiles.

     Mighty Joe Young emerges from the brush, not growling,
     not threatening, but rather looking like a puppy coming
     to greet his master.

     Absolutely thunderstruck, watching in awe as the giant
     GORILLA bows his head so Jill can scratch behind his ear.
     He makes LOW, GUTTURAL SOUNDS that are the gorilla
     equivalent of a purr.

     Jill inspects Joe, checking him to see if he's okay.       Her
     voice is full of gentle concern and worry.

     We see the fear in Jill's face, knowing that Joe can't
     understand what she's saying. She shakes it off and
     brightens. She gives Joe a playful tussle, then covers
     her eyes with her hands.

     Suddenly, she dashes into the woods -- where she's
     actually small enough to hide well. Joe passes by her,
     moving through the foliage.

     In a moment we see how much he fears actually losing her
     -- he begins to WHIMPER -- and spins around. He stands
     up to his full height, beats his chest and shakes his
     head in frustration. He can't bear the idea that she is
     gone.

     A beat, then Joe starts tearing bushes out by their roots,
     hunting for Jill. He sees one BUSH RUSTLING, goes over
     and rips it out of the ground, revealing...

     Standing there, completely exposed, filming all this

     Gregg stumbles backwards, trapping himself against a tree
     as Joe advances. Remembering what one should do when
     faced with an enraged gorilla. Gregg averts his eyes and
     rolls into a ball, assuming the submissive position. He's
     like a pill bug, playing dead, protecting the back of his
     neck with his arms.

     Joe raises his mighty fist -- it looks like he might
     smash Gregg anyway... but then he hears Jill's voice.

     Joe looks back at Gregg, still curled into a tight ball.
     He gives him a playful, parting swat for good measure
     before obeying Jill and running into the forest.

     The "little swat" is powerful enough to send Gregg rolling
     like a croquet ball into a thicket of bushes. Painfully,
     he uncurls, plucking nettles out of his legs as Jill
     approaches.

     A poacher's truck, carrying six rowdy poachers, speeds
     down the main street, kicking up a cloud of dust. The

     some of the damaged equipment in his truck.

     Across the street at the bar, a chorus of CACKLES rises
     from a group of drunken poachers. The mere sound of them
     makes Jill dig her fingers into her arms with anxiety.

     She looks across at the poachers -- and then back to
     Gregg, packing up. If she doesn't say this right now,
     this second, she never will. She snaps.

     Jill pulls herself away from the back window and faces
     front again. She stares out at the nondescript sprawl of
     greater L.A. It looks like non-place. There is no

     position -- but he's so nervous that he trips, sprawling
     on the ground and startling Joe. Joe turns and scampers
     back into the trailer.

      Jill and Gregg are at a door that Gregg is unlocking.
      Jill paces angrily and storms through the door as Gregg
      opens it. CAMERA FOLLOWS Gregg in. He's carrying her
      bags.

      Gregg is grim and quiet. He thinks what she's saying is
      true. He sets her bags down, detesting the antiseptic
      space as much as she does.

      Feeling claustrophobic, Jill dashes to the window and
      tries to open it. It's a double-paned window. The top
      doesn't open at all -- the bottom cranks open three
      inches, barely letting in air. Jill pushes on the
      window, horrified?

      It only takes a second. Gregg grabs a pillow from the
      couch and lays it against the top portion of the window.
      He gives it one swift karate chop, breaking out the glass.
      He methodically breaks out the remaining shards, dusts off
      the pillow, and carefully replaces it on the couch.

      Jill just stares at him, open-mouthed.    Gregg looks her
      straight in the eye.

       The CAMERA LEAVES Jill's window and FINDS Joe, sitting in
       his man-made grassy field, looking equally lost and
       lonely. He is unsure of what to do with himself, confused
       by his surroundings.

<b>       PAN TO:

<b>51B    EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT               51B

       The CAMERA FINDS Gregg, leaning against the bar at the
       edge of the moat. His face is soft as he watches Joe.

       Joe lists his mammoth head and looks up towards the right
       corner of his habitat. Gregg follows Joe's eyeline and
       sees that Joe is looking at a TRANSFORMER. The ELECTRIC
       BUZZ reaches Gregg's ear... and he becomes aware of it in
       a new way. He hears its HUM the way Joe hears it --
       strange, menacing.

       Gregg shakes his head to himself -- why didn't the
       designers pay attention to this? He looks back at Joe,
       almost apologetically, and is startled to find that:

       Joe is looking back at him.

       It is the first time these two have had real eye contact,
       and for Gregg it is almost overwhelming. Man and beast
       read each other's faces, and it is in this moment that
       the giant ape becomes more than a phenomenon to Gregg.
       Gregg finally feels some of what Jill has been feeling.
       He connects to Joe.

       And Joe connects to Gregg. It's just a blink of the eye,
       a turn of the head -- but it's there. And they both feel
       it.

                  the Pangani carry a recessive gene

</b>                  Both Joe and Jill's mothers were
                  killed by poachers, twelve years
                  ago, in the Pangani Forest,
                  orphaning them on the same night.

</b>
     Emotion surging through him. He realizes now, all at
     once, exactly who Joe and Jill are.

                  Bloody hell. That's the little
                  monster that...

     Garth stops abruptly, glancing at Strasser's hand. He
     knows better than to mention it directly. Strasser looks
     down...

     tanned, manicured, and missing the thumb and forefinger.
     The leather he's been polishing this whole time is his
     prosthetic hand. He straps it back on.

                  I am always amazed how, if you
                  wait long enough, the opportunity
                  for justice finally comes.

     Garth watches his boss, who seems lost in his private
     dream of revenge. It's a moment before Strasser looks
     back at him.

     He looks back at the TV, where Jill is on screen.

       CLOSE ON the sleepy face of a shaggy yak. PULL BACK TO
       a small group of V.I.P.s being led on a tour by Harry.

                 would ask, why should we care if
                 this sub-species of yak survives?

       We SPOT a man blending in with the group. We recognize
       Garth. He looks quite respectable in a suit. The antsy
       V.I.P. next to Garth interrupts Harry.

       The other V.I.P.s echo this wish.   Harry refocuses
       himself.

                 night's benefit.

       The V.I.P.s laugh and groan. Garth takes this moment
       to slip away, unnoticed. Harry twinkles at the V.I.P.s.

       Jill and Cecily drive up in an electric cart. Jill
       jumps out, wearing a conservancy T-shirt, and from the
       looks of things she's been working hard in the habitat
       all day. She's a lovely mess, head to toe.

      an old married couple.

      Jill smiles to herself. She turns to get back to her
      other business, and almost walks right into:

      Gregg. He's been leaning against a wall, and he's
      caught the whole thing.

                   called me in Africa. I would have
                   brought 'em back for ya.

      Jill just stares for a moment, trying to decide how to
      handle Gregg's sudden reappearnce. His clothes look
      travelled in, and another month in Africa has put a
      deeper shade of brown on his face. He's got the ragged
      look of someone who's just gotten off a 16-hour flight.

      business to attend to. Gregg falls in beside her.

      melt that easily. He continues.

      Gregg reaches out and pulls a piece of straw from Jill's
      tossled locks. She can't help herself anymore -- and
      breaks into a slow smile.

      Garth walks quickly -- but not fast enough to draw
      attention. He moves along the handrail at the edge of
      the moat. Takes off his sunglasses and looks for Joe.

      as he reaches in his pocket and pulls out one of the
      poaching dog collars. Garth looks around -- then gives
      the metal clappers one loud shake -- quickly drops them
      back into his pocket.

      Joe reacts immediately to the JANGLING sound. Imprinted
      deep in his memory. He rises up quickly and GROWLS
      furiously -- pounding his chest -- looking around for the
      danger. It's instinctive and frightening. Joe sees Garth
      and charges him. Joe's anger takes him into the
      electrified wire around the habitat. JOE ROARS at the
      shock and recoils.

      through the air. It's a magic night.

      Gregg and Jill walk away from a funky food shack,
      festooned with tiny lights. They share a carton of
      fish and chips.

      Jill has done her job.    Joe is calm but spent, leaning
      against a tree.

      Jill sits in his lap, softly singing the same lullaby
      we heard her mother sing to her 12 years ago.

      She caresses the palm of Joe's giant leathery paw, her
      tiny white hand almost disappearing in its black folds.

      Gregg watches, leaning against a tree not ten feet away.
      It is the most intimate moment between Jill and Joe that
      he has seen yet. The tableau invokes myth: the beauty
      in the service of the beast; the man who has come to
      free her.

<b>     BY ENTRANCE
</b>
     Jill has just stepped into the tent, looking absolutely
     stunning. All heads turn too look at her. Intimidated,
     she falters at the door, too afraid to enter.


<b>     BACK ON STAFF
</b>
     Like everyone else in the room, Cecily and Harry admire
     Jill. Gregg is rendered speechless by her beauty.

<b>                                GREGG
</b>                  Brilliant.

     Gregg picks up a glass of champagne for Jill and starts
     crossing the room to her.

<b>                                CECILY

                  catching flies.


<b>     ON JILL
</b>
     Feeling terribly insecure, Jill gratefully watches Gregg
     cross the room towards her. They can't take their eyes
     off each other. When he reaches her side, she grabs on
     to him.

                  Tell me the truth -- do I look

                  staring at me.

                  They're staring at that... uh...
                  banana tower.

     Jill turns and sees a ridiculous-looking decorative
     mountain of bananas sitting on a table top just behind
     her. It's the creation of an over-zealous caterer.

     Jill blushes, realizing Gregg's joking.

                  have your attention, please?

     The two of them head for the exit.

                  spectacular, that it literally
                  took your breath away? Well,
                  prepare yourselves, for tonight
                  you will have such an experience.


<b>     WITH STRASSER AND GARTH
</b>
     Heading for the exit, they hear Baker's words and exchange
     a knowing glance -- if they have their way, tonight will
     be more of an "experience" than Baker is bargaining for.
     Garth slips his hand into his jacket, checking for the
     dog collar...

     Just as Jack and Vern start coming the other way. Jack's
     already had one glass too many, and he's reckless on his
     feet.

     Smack! Jack collides with Garth, causing Garth to drop
     the dog collar. Vern stoops to retrieve it, (picking it
     up by a rusty key that is one of the clanking objects on
     the collar).

                  chain.

     Garth grabs it back.      Strasser nods coolly to Vern and
     Jack.

     Vern and Jack stumble on, none the wiser.

     Strasser and Garth slip out.


<b>77   EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                             77
</b>
     Joe is feeding on bamboo in the center of his habitat
     when something abruptly catches his ear. A slight
     JANGLING sound, the TIMPANI of WIND CHIMES, floating
     through the air. It GROWS LOUDER.

     Joe stands up. The hair on his neck bristles. He moves
     towards the source of the sound, at the edge of the moat.


<b>     JOE'S POV
</b>
     Garth stands at the railing surrounding the moat,
     rattling the dog collars. It's a sound that haunts him,
     from the darkest depths of his memory. He starts to GROWL
     and then he sees something that really drives him nuts.

     Strasser steps into the light, joining Garth by the
     water's edge. He rattles the dog collar, and now...


<b>     ZOOM IN ON JOE
</b>
     His eyes, locking with Strasser's. His pupils narrow,
     his nostrils flare, and Joe FREAKS OUT!

     He starts tearing up the ground, beating his chest, then
     he ROARS and charges straight for them, stopping at the
     water's edge.

     locking eyes with Joe. This is the first time he has seen
     Joe since the animal bit his hand off twelve years ago. A
     smile creeps across his face.

                          dead hand)
                  Have you forgotten this?

     Garth is still rattling the dog collar, enjoying Joe's
     display of rage.

                  piece, who knows how much we'll
                  make?

     Garth shakes the dog collar more furiously, making Joe
     rush at them again.

<b>                                GARTH

                  And come back for it -- after.

     Garth hangs the dog collar on the fence. Joe can hear it
     clank in the breeze -- he is in a truly frightening state.

</b>                  Come, we've done our job here.

     As Strasser and Garth leave, Joe looks after them, beside
     himself with fury. Outraged, he turns this way and that
     way, finally focusing on a tall tree in his habitat.

     At the podium, Baker is making his presentation to the
     tony crowd.

               like to bring up to the podium the
               director of the conservancy...

     A sudden ROAR coming from behind the curtain drowns out
     Baker's voice. The audience members jump in their seats,
     frightened. Baker is rattled, too, then regains his
     composure.

<b>                             BAKER
</b>               Well! I suppose there's no need
               to add to that introduction.

     The audience laughs and relaxes.

<b>                             BAKER
</b>               Here's Dr. Harry Ruben.

     Baker motions to Harry, who freezes with a sudden bout of
     stage fright. Cecily gives him a discreet push on the
     back and he stumbles forward.

     JOE can still be heard GROWLING and beating his chest in
     the background. Jill and Gregg look at each other with
     mounting anxiety.

     Harry reaches the mic.

<b>                             HARRY

               Extinct. Never to return. We

               is a tragedy...

     Another O.S. ROAR from JOE. It is spine-tingling.    Harry
     almost jumps out of his loafers.

     be really afraid -- they're just excited and twittering.

     Jill is feeling increasingly nervous. She glances around
     the room and meets eyes with Strasser. He nods at her,
     his eyes indicating that he is "worried" for Joe as well.
     Jill nods back.

     We continue to hear uncanny SOUNDS from behind the curtain.
     It's all Harry can do to stick to his speech. He keeps
     glancing nervously over his shoulder.

                  introduce you to something we've
                  found.

     There is a tremendous CRACKING sound from behind the
     curtain. The audience murmurs. Harry sweats. Jill
     grabs Gregg's hand tightly.

     CRASH! Before Harry can say "Young," a TREE comes
     CRASHING through the curtain.

     Gregg leaps forward, knocking Harry out of the way just
     as the tree crushes the podium into kindling.

     Joe comes blasting through the hole in the curtain.    He
     has joined the party.

     Joe stands on the stage, his chest heaving. There is
     total silence. The party guests are frozen with fear,
     literally speechless. A few of them laugh nervously,
     wondering if this is really just part of the show.

     But Jill knows better. She and Gregg exchange glances
     -- what the hell is going on?

     Jill rises, trying to stay calm herself, and slowly
     approaches Joe, speaking in a soothing voice. She
     wants to get his attention.

     Jill is within arm's reach of Joe -- it looks like he
     might turn his head to her, calm down, become docile...

     But that's when he spots Strasser. Joe's face registers
     towering rage as Strasser stares back, provoking Joe
     further.

     Joe takes off, knocking over a table that bangs into Jill
     and sends her flying backwards into a wall. She hits the
     wall and sinks down, stunned.

     heads through the people towards Strasser.        The party

     hoists him into the air.

      Strasser is trapped behind a table. JOE throws the
      table out of his way, ROARS and is about to crush a
      cowering Strasser into poacher mulch, when...

      SFX: the EXPLOSION of a RIFLE.   Joe looks surprised at
      first.

      Joe drops to all fours, revealing Gregg holding a tranq
      gun. Other Animal Control Officers are with him, also
      holding tranq rifles.

      Gregg lowers his gun, a pained expression on his face.

      But one tranq dart is not enough to stop Mighty Joe.    He
      rises again, ready to smash Strasser...

      And a HAIL of TRANQ DARTS sail through the air as the
      conservancy workers pepper Joe with SHOTS.

      Joe swipes several darts from his flank -- but the
      accumulation is too much even for him. He stumbles
      backward and falls.

      Jill screams.   Gregg looks sick at the sight of Joe
      falling.

      Joe hits the ground hard.   His eyes close.

     Gregg leans against the cage next to Joe. They have never

     He leaves the room, brushing shoulders with Gregg,

     he's overheard the whole thing.

     Jill and Gregg look at each other with determination in

     It's Strasser. Avoiding the back of the trailer (where
     he would encounter Joe), Strasser stays where he is and
     calls out to Jill in hushed tones.

<b>                                STRASSER
</b>                  Jill, I got the plane. It's
                  waiting at the airport. We must
                  hurry.

     Strasser holds his hand up in salute to Gregg and Cecily --
     that's about as close as he wants to get to them. Using
     urgency as an excuse, he jumps back into the trailer
     before anyone can engage him in further conversation.

     It's time to say good-bye.    Cecily looks into the back of
     the trailer.

<b>                                CECILY
</b>                  I'm going to miss your ugly face.
                  Be good, Joe.

<b>                                HARRY (O.S.)
</b>                  Yeah. Don't start a fight with
                  anyone bigger than you.

     Harry steps out of the shadows. Everyone turns and looks
     at him. He feels their eyes on him and shuffles a
     little.

<b>                                HARRY
</b>                  You'd better leave out of the
                  west gate. The guard there got
                  called away. Urgent business.

     Jill puts her arms around Harry.    He's antsy and
     embarrassed.

                          hugging)
                  Okay, okay, let go.

     Harry disengages from Jill and disappears back where he
     came from.

     Now Cecily turns to Jill.    She hugs her with great emotion.

     Cecily moves off, leaving Gregg and Jill alone to say
     good-bye. They look into each other's eyes, hating to
     part, everything they have to say to each other still
     unsaid.

                  you a head start before they
                  realize he's gone.

     Jill is crumbling. For her, it's awful to leave him, but
     he's not acting heart-broken at all. Confused, she tries
     desperately to stay light. She chatters like a nervous
     schoolgirl.

     She doesn't get the rest of her sentence out because Gregg
     is kissing her mouth. It's the kiss he's been wanting to
     give her since the day he first laid eyes on her.

     He lets go of her again, leaving her breathlessly looking
     after him. He walks to the back of the trailer.

     Gregg and Joe make serious eyes contact.

                  Take care of her for me, will ya?

     Gregg shuts the trailer door and walks off, not daring to
     look back. Jill is about to call after him when Strasser
     steps back out of the passenger's side of the trailer.
     He whispers urgently:

<b>                                 STRASSER

      Hopping into the trailer, Jill comes face to face with
      Garth, who is sitting behind the steering wheel. He
      nods to her, all business.

<b>                              GARTH

      Strasser gets in on the other side of Jill, closing the
      door behind him. She's sandwiched.

      Gregg stops and turns around for one last look at the
      trailer as it drives off.

      Cecily exhales -- this love stuff is too hot to handle
      -- and follows Gregg.

      Just then, Vern and Jack drive up in a Blazer.      They stop
      next to Gregg and Cecily.

      Jack and Vern hop out of the car.       Vern is carrying a
      cardboard box.

      Vern pulls a single high-heeled shoe out of the box and
      hands it to Cecily.

      poacher's dog collar. It means nothing to him, but
      Gregg instantly grabs for it.

      Jill glances nervously back as they drive down surface
      streets. She looks over at Strasser. In the passing
      light of the street lamps, he is regaining his sinister
      sheen.

      Garth is driving the trailer very fast. They hit a
      bump, making them lurch in their seat. Jill hears JOE
      go THUD in the trailer.

      His tone has something vaguely malevolent in it.    It

      Jill looks at Strasser sharply. For the first time, she
      really notices his strange, leather hand. For reasons
      she's not yet conscious of, it scares her.

      Strasser notices that Jill is staring at his hand.

                  Monstrule.

     Strasser and Garth chuckle -- they think they're just
     sharing a private joke.

     But Jill has a troubled look in her eyes -- the foreign
     epithet has struck a chord from long ago... she struggles
     to remember...

     Then she gets it. She sees herself crouching in the
     forest with Joe over 12 years ago, overhearing Strasser's
     curses, and her blood runs cold. She glances at
     Strasser, everything dawning on her at once. The hand...
     the face... it all comes together for Jill.

     Strasser catches the look on Jill's face and knows some-
     thing is wrong. Adrenaline is pumping through her.
     Unsure of how to make her next move, Jill tries to hide
     the realization that is crashing down on her...

     She glances in the side view mirror of the truck and
     sees:

     Gregg, driving up behind them in the Conservancy vehicle.
     Jill's face reacts ever so slightly, but Strasser catches
     it. He follows her eye line, looking where she looked,
     and as he also spots Gregg, Jill knows the game is up.
     She loses it and screams:

     face reflexively goes down in his hands. Stunned, Garth
     swerves at the wheel. Fast as lightning, Jill grabs his
     hair and slams his face into the dash.

     Before the men can recover, Jill kicks and claws her way
     over Strasser's back, fighting toward the open window...

      She reaches through the window and grabs onto the side
      view mirror. The truck door swings open and Jill sails
      out the door, dangling from her hold on the side view.

      The speeding truck swerves wildly, banging Jill again and

      Ray looks down the street at the approaching cop cars and
      back at Joe. He understands the danger.

      Ray points the right way for Joe to go, away from the
      police cars. Joe watches Ray closely, as if he were

      Gregg ENTERS FRAME. He vaults the guard rail, starts
      unloading children right from their moving cars.

      There is utter chaos, children screaming, fire and smoke.
      CRANE UP PAST the terrified faces of the children who
      have to wait, 'til we GET TO Jenny and Emma. Jenny turns
      to see the fire beneath them.

<b>      FIRE
</b>
      is really starting to burn out of control now. It has
      spread to the engine of the FERRIS WHEEL, which, heated
      to the bursting point, suddenly EXPLODES.

      The ride operator with the fire extinguisher is blown
      through the air, and the Ferris wheel lurches to a halt.


<b>      JENNY AND EMMA
</b>
      grip their safety bar as their bucket swings back and
      forth. Emma nearly falls out -- until Jenny grabs her
      and holds her tight.

      Gregg -- sees the girls, their bucket having come to a
      stop about fifteen feet off the ground. Thinking
      quickly, he jumps up on the guard railing, then leaps
      across to their bucket.

      He just grabs onto the bottom. The bucket shakes back
      and forth violently, causing the two girls to scream.
      Gregg looks up at them.

<b>                                 GREGG
</b>                   Don't be scared. Climb down my

      Tentatively, Jenny and Emma climb out of their bucket and
      onto Gregg's back, using him like a human ladder. They
      shimmy down to his feet, then drop off, one by one, into
      the waiting arms of their mother.

      Gregg lets go of the bucket, drops a good fifteen feet,
      landing roughly. The girls' mother looks down at Gregg,
      thankfully.

      Jill moves through the maze of carnival games. She spots
      Joe, moving through the small buildings, clearly
      disoriented. She yells out...

</b>                Joe!   Joe!!

      But above the tumult, he can't hear her. Jill pushes her
      way towards him, when she comes face to face with...

      Strasser. Just yards away.      He flashes his sickening
      smile, raises his gun...

      ON JILL -- a look of terror crossing her face as she
      realizes she's about to die. Then, as a shadow passes
      over her, her expression of terror melts away.

      ON STRASSER -- seeing Jill's expression, his smile fades.
      Why's she so calm all of a sudden? He doesn't even need
      to turn around to know that:

      Joe is behind him. As Strasser turns slowly around, Joe
      reaches down swiftly and hoists Strasser off the ground.
      The GUN GOES OFF, barely missing Joe. JOE ROARS and
      crushes Strasser's left hand in his paw, a bone-crunching,
      slow squeeze that makes Strasser scream in agony.

      Then Joe swings Strasser around and grabs him around the
      chest with his right paw. He pulls him close to his face
      and blasts a DEAFENING ROAR into his face. Joe cocks his
      arm and heaves Strasser with mighty force into the air.

      Screaming, Strasser hurtles through space with incredible
      speed, CRASHING right through the flaming signage of the
      "Big Safari" booth, sending out a SHOWER OF SPARKS...

      ... and continues flying through the air until WHACK!      He
      hangs up on a power line.

      Strasser slips down, catching his fall with his fake hand.
      This section of the LINE is safe, but directly below it is
      a cluster of electrical junction boxes. Cracked and
      blistered by the heat of the nearby fire, they are sparking
      dangerously -- to fall on to them would mean certain
      electrocution.

      Strasser's bad hand begins to slip from the wire.
      Desperate, he reaches up with his left hand to grab on --
      only to remember that this hand has just been crushed
      by Joe, and is useless to him now.

      Strasser helplessly watches as his prosthetic comes
      unclasped from his hand and he slips the last, fatal
      fraction of an inch.

      Strasser falls onto the junction boxes, which explode in
      a shower of sparks. Strasser sizzles and dies, while above
      him, the prosthesis still swings on the wire.

      of what has just happened. A dozen people scream and
      recoil.

      A swarm of policemen, led by Commander Gorman, watch

      He's not looking at the cops. He's focused on the Ferris

                   right, big guy. That was a big
                   fall but you're okay, aren't
                   you? You're tough. You're so

      Jason pushes in front of his mother. He reaches out his
      little hand and pets Joe. He looks up at Jill and Gregg
      with a shining face and smiles hopefully.

<b>      (ALTERNATE END OF SCENE)

      Jill shakes her head at the mother and continues to pet
      Joe softly.

                   No. I don't think so. Not unless
                   you have a few million dollars on
                   you to buy him a home somewhere.

      Jason's mother nods hopelessly, comprehending the
      difficulty of the situation. But Jason has also heard
      Jill's words. He pushes in front of his mother, reaches
      into his pocket and pulls out a crumpled dollar bill. He
      hands it to Jill and Gregg with a shining face and smiles
      hopefully.

      Gregg and Jill are moved by the gesture. Gregg respect-
      fully takes the dollar from the little boy while everyone
      looks on.

      Gorman and his men exchange glances, also touched by the
      little boy's deed. Now Gorman reaches into his pocket and
      pulls out a ten. He comes forward and hands it to Gregg.

      Gregg's hands and pockets are being stuffed with money as
      dozens of people begin to come forward with whatever they
      can afford. Gregg looks at Jill, overwhelmed by what's
      happening, and her face echoes his emotions...

      An entry gate with the words "Joe Young Wildlife Park"
      printed across the top.

      Beneath the gate: Kweli, standing with Jill and Gregg,
      is blowing a ceremonial horn, sending an ancient blessing
      into the air. As he finishes, we hear applause.

      PULL BACK to reveal 35 people -- locals, villagers,
      friends -- applauding the opening of the park.

                you when Joe was settled and now I
                finally can. We finally dedicated
                the Joe Young Wildlife Park last
                week and it was one of the
                happiest days of my life. At last
                I have kept my promise to my
                mother.

      Under the gate, Jill jumps joyously on Gregg, and he
      whirls her around in a tight embrace.

                he feels that he's safe.

      Gregg looks O.S. and waves.

      Joe comes walking INTO FRAME. Gregg smiles at Jill, very
      pleased with himself that Joe responds to him now, too.

                had? It's all gone.

      Joe swats Gregg to the ground and takes his place next
      to Jill.

      Not completely amused, Gregg picks himself up and raises
      a warning finger at Joe. Joe looks over at him, and
      purses his lips at Gregg, as if laughing at his own
      rough play.

      Joe turns and walks away up the hillside. Jill helps
      Gregg up. He puts his arm around her and kisses her
      hair. They watch Joe go.
