</b>
          CU on two concerned eyes. The same eyes as the paintings. We
          REVEAL they belong to a real girl: JANE, 8. She sits in her
          small house -- a typical young family's, spare and
          underfurnished.

          Suddenly -- Jane's mother MARGARET ULBRICH, 28, rushes through
          frame. Margaret is blonde, yearning, fragile. Terribly
          upset, she is hurriedly packing.
          Margaret throws her clothes in a suitcase.
          She shoves Jane's clothes and toys into another.
          Margaret barrels through the breakfast nook, which is a mini
          art studio -- easel, canvases, paints. She scoops up her
          supplies.

          Margaret runs to the door -- then turns. The hallway is lined
          with her PAINTINGS. Oils and inks of wide-eyed Jane, who
          grows from baby to toddler to child. Hastily, Margaret takes
          them down, each frame leaving an empty mark on the flowered
          wallpaper. Finally she reaches the last spot -- a WEDDING
          PHOTO: Margaret and her HUSBAND, smiling, happy.
          Margaret peers -- then leaves it hanging. The door SLAMS.

          Margaret grips the wheel, uncertain. Jane stares. The car is
          all loaded up. REFLECTIONS of passing BILLBOARDS drift across
          the windshield. Images of perky, happy-fake Americans.
          Margaret bites her lip. Has she made the right decision...?

          A beaten industrial office. Margaret sits anxiously, watching
          the BOSS, a tired guy in a cheap suit. He glowers unsurely at
          her JOB APPLICATION. Scratching his face. Hmmmm...

</b>           Sir, I realize I have no employment

           could just show you my portfolio...
          He is baffled. Margaret pulls out a large ARTIST'S PORTFOLIO.
          She opens it, riffling through the pictures...

<b>                          MARGARET

          NORTH BEACH! An exotica of Beatniks, palm readers,
          interracial couples and coffeehouses. Ground zero for the
          Avant Garde. Margaret waits on a busy corner, a bit dazed,
          peering at the parade of fun-loving Hipsters. Primly, she
          fixes herself.
          Margaret turns -- and suddenly grins. Running up is DEE-ANN,
          30, a Beat girl in a black leotard and sandals. Dee-Ann
          excitedly grabs her, and they laugh and hug girlishly.

           and "Deirdre" just sounded like

          Margaret giggles.

          The modern stalls are crowded with trendy BOHEMIANS. Abstract
          lines, speckles of color. We drift away... and find Margaret,
          alone in her stall with Jane. Margaret sits patiently,
          surrounded by Big Eye paintings and charcoal portraits. In
          contrast with the neighbors, her work seems... quaint.

          Beat -- then she nods, agreeing. She gestures.
          The little BOY sits. Margaret clips a fresh sheet of paper,
          sharpens her charcoal... and... goes motionless. Studying the
          boy's face. He gazes back.
          Then -- inspired, she begins sketching his EYES. Large and
          exaggerated. Then she fills in the shape of his head. His
          ears. His jaw.
          In a rush, his likeness appears. The parents come over to
          peek -- then gasp. Margaret is good. She sketches faster.
          Focused. Until a LOUD, PLUMMY VOICE drifts in...

          handsome. And dressed like an "Artist" -- striped turtleneck,
          with hands full of brushes.
          Walter's stall is filled with oils of Paris street scenes. He
          casually flirts with TWO YOUNG COEDS. They admire a painting.

          Walter glances over -- and notices Margaret watching him.
          Shy, she quickly turns away, back to her portrait.
          Walter smiles rakishly. He's found a new interest.

<b>                          WALTER

</b>          Walter strides up to Margaret. She peers nervously... trying
          to ignore him. She sketches faster. Shading...
          Walter watches. Admiring... and discreetly smelling her hair.
          Margaret pays no attention. Done, she blows into a can of Fix-
          It. Poosh! A fine mist sprays, setting the portrait.
          Without fanfare, she humbly turns the picture.

<b>                          MARGARET

          out four quarters, then happily leaves.

          it hits him. He grimaces, embarrassed.

          have set-up TWO EASELS. They both smoke cigarettes. Margaret
          is spattered with paint, stirring colors. Walter paces about,
          framing the scene with his fingers.
          Jane sits in front of them, playing paddleball. Bonk! Bonk!

          Margaret winces. Walter laughs. She gets busy, penciling in
          LARGE OVAL EYES. Then -- quick marks for the mouth and nose.
          Impatient, Jane spies on Walter's canvas.

          The door opens. Margaret holds it for Walter, who
          chivalrously staggers in, carrying all her supplies: Easel,
          paints, cans. He carefully puts it all down -- then turns.
          Beat. Walter stares at Margaret, their faces caught in the

          Margaret flips through envelopes -- until one stops her. On

          Dee-Ann raises an eyebrow.

<b>                          DEE-ANN
</b>           This is all happening mighty quick.
           In the time you moved here, I've had
           two dates. You're already married.

           Well... Walter's filled it.

<b>                          DEE-ANN
</b>           Walter's filled a lot of things. He's
           diddled every skirt on the art circuit.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           You're talking about my husband!

<b>                          DEE-ANN
</b>           I know! That's why I brought it up.
          Margaret frowns, insulted.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I'm not naive.
           (beat; she laughs)
           Well, I am naive. But I know the man
           I'm marrying. Walter can act rash...
           but he's a good provider. And he's
           wonderful with Jane.

<b>                          (CLEAR-EYED)
</b>           Look -- we're both looking for a fresh
           start. I'm a divorcee with a child.
           Walter is a blessing.
          Dee-Ann bites her tongue. The WAITER brings over the check.
          Sitting on it are TWO FORTUNE COOKIES.
          Hm. Margaret stares, utterly serious. She reaches for one...
          then impulsively grabs the other. She cracks the cookie. Dee-
          Ann waits, curious. Margaret reads... then slowly smiles.

<b>                          MARGARET

<b>          INT. ART GALLERY - DAY
</b>
          A Modish, happening gallery. The white walls are hung with
          ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: Slashing angles of color, painted over
          rags and glued bolts. On the floor is SCULPTURE made from
          wood and wire.
          In charge is RUBEN, a fussy man in a goatee. He's schmoozing
          a FANCY LADY. They look at a spattered, distorted painting.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           What's brilliant about the composition
           is its spontaneity. The image has no
           visual center of attention.

<b>                          FANCY LADY
</b>           It's quite gestural.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by
           the tachistes.

<b>                          FANCY LADY
</b>           I heard Tab Hunter was in here,
           looking at one.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Well... I'm not allowed to say...
          He NODS HIS HEAD up-and-down: Yes, you're right.

<b>                         OUTSIDE
</b>          A car backfires. Ruben turns -- and winces.

<b>           18.
</b>
                         
          Through the windows is Walter, climbing out of his massive
          white Cadillac. He's all done up, in beret and scarf. He
          opens the giant trunk and removes a pile of paintings.
          Ruben cringes knowingly. He whispers:

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Oh Christ, don't come in here. Please
           don't come in here...
          The door SLAMS. Walter loudly barges in.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute?

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Walter. In polite society, the word
           is "appointment."

<b>                          FANCY LADY
</b>           (glancing back and forth)
           Uh, I could come back later...
          She anxiously hurries for the door. Ruben fumes.
          Walter ignores it all and starts laying out his wares. First,
          the Parisian street scenes, one after another...

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           You're gonna love my stuff today.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Haven't I seen that one before?

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Nah! That was painted in the Fifth
           Arrondissement. This is the Sixth
           Arrondissement!

<b>                          RUBEN

<b>                          (SKEPTICAL)
</b>           I don't understand. You lived in
           Paris for a week. How can you still
           be cranking out paintings?
          Walter laughs. He points to his head.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           It's all up here.
           (beat; a sentimental

<b>                          FLOURISH)
</b>           And here.
          He points to his heart. Ruben frowns and points to the wall.

<b>           19.

<b>                          RUBEN

<b>                          (CRUEL)
</b>           Walter, you know we don't go for that
           representational jazz! You're too
           literal.

<b>                          (CUTTING)
</b>           People want Kandinsky, or Rothko!
           They don't want goopy street scenes.

<b>          CLOSEUP - WALTER
</b>          Ouch! This stings terribly.
          Walter glares at the man, then softly slides aside his works.
          Quietly, he pulls out Margaret's Big Eye paintings.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Would they want... this?

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           No... they're my wife's.
          Fascinated, Ruben glances through Margaret's oils. Canvas
          after canvas of sad kiddies against gray, bleak backgrounds.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           Why are their eyes so big?! They're
           like big stale jellybeans.

</b>
<b>                          (SNIDE)

           recognize it.

           each other.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           So... what do you say?
          Ruben looks up, amazed. Walter seems oblivious.

<b>                          RUBEN
</b>           It's like the back of a magazine!
           "Draw the turtle! Send in a nickel
           and win the Big Contest!"

<b>                          WALTER

          Margaret and Walter are squeezed at a table. She nurses a
          Grasshopper. Walter's in a foul mood, CHUGGING cocktails.

<b>                          WALTER

          O.s., MUSIC BUILDS. Muddled, Walter turns. He looks -- and
          then -- his eyes light up. He is getting an idea...

          The crowd APPLAUDS. The club's owner, ENRICO BANDUCCI, bounds
          on stage. Banducci is a theatrical, natty Italian guy with a
          skinny moustache and loud personality. He grabs a mike.

          The image is grim. Walter listens to the raucous mob. Until,

          oblivious to Walter. He glowers. ANOTHER MAN bounds in,
          right up to one of Walter's paintings! He stops at it.
          Walter gathers a moment of hope. Does he like it?
          Then the man leans down and opens a CLOSET. He removes a tray
          of bar glasses, kicks the door shut, and scoots away.

<b>          ANGLE - OLIVETTI

          hair and sunglasses. He approaches closer, closer... when he
          gets distracted. By one of Margaret's Big Eye PAINTINGS.
          Walter gasps. He nudges Margaret.
          Olivetti peers at the artwork. Intrigued. Then -- excited.
          He starts gesturing and yapping in ITALIAN. The Blondes shout
          back. Everyone is getting worked-up.
          The big-bosomed Blonde turns to Walter.

           who is the artist?

<b>          ANGLE - MARGARET AND WALTER
</b>          The moment of truth. Margaret opens her mouth... and no sound
          comes out. She clenches up. Stomach tight. Mute.
          Walter gives her a second -- tick tock tick tock. Then -- he
          leaps into Opportunity. He SMACKS his hands.

<b>                          WALTER

          Walter swoops over and grabs Olivetti in a hearty clasp.

</b>           It's a delight to meet you, Signore!
           Buon giorno! Have you been an art
           lover for long..?
          We move in tight on MARGARET, as the SOUND DIALS DOWN.

           of girl, cat, and stairs... and its
           almost Flemish use of underpigment...
          The SOUND dims... then goes SILENT.
          Margaret stares in shock, unmoving.
          Time seems to stop. She is frozen in grief. Until --

          Margaret glances in a mirror. It's a self-portrait. It's
          Margaret, aloof. Alone at a table.
          Suddenly the door opens. Margaret GASPS, startled, and spins
          the canvas away. Walter barges in, dressed like a million.
          He HALTS -- making a sour face.

</b>           Whew! Something smells in here. You
           should open a window.
          Margaret blinks, a bit dazed.

</b>           I dunno. 6:30, 7? ...Didn't Janie

          Margaret gulps, fretting. Finally, without options -- she
          flips over the canvas of the lonely blonde.
          And -- Walter is taken aback. His eyebrows raise, shocked.
          Margaret bites her lip. Will he go ballistic?

</b>           That seems a bit confusing. "Keane"

           from successful careers to travel the
           globe, live on a boat...
          We move... finding Margaret alone in a small ANNEX. It
          displays a few of her sad blondes, alongside Jane and Lily's
          paintings of flowers and Mr. Potato-Head. Margaret sits,
          seeming like an adult at the children's table.
          An urbane RICH MAN glides by... and is taken with one of
          Margaret's nubile blondes. He gazes at the lounging figure.
          Margaret sits up. Alert, pleased with his interest.
          She tingles. Then, happily excited, unable to hold it in:

           of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8! If
           you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives
           you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals
           16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven!
          The man's head is spinning. He's lost all interest.

          Hm? Margaret puts down her brush, wipes her hands, then
          hurries out. She opens the door... REVEALING THAT WE'RE IN A

          Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint.

          Walter rushes to the Waif, then for show grabs up the wet

          Suddenly -- an odd expression crosses his face. He eyeballs
          the canvas, realizing he doesn't know what to do.
          A furtive glance. Then, unbowed, he hastily dips the brush
          and slaps a little black onto the shaded background.

          Margaret peers hopelessly at her daughter... then goes inside.

</b>
          Margaret strolls to her studio. WE SEE the poodle scampering
          behind her on its cute little legs. She enters the

<b>          INT. PAINTING ROOM
</b>
          Margaret doesn't notice the tiny dog follow her in. She LOCKS
          the door, then turns -- surprised.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Where did you appear from? Didn't you
           hear? No visitors!
          Rembrandt wags his tail, his little eyes bright. Margaret
          peers.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Is this what it's come to? You're the
           only living soul I can tell my secret?
           (she lowers her voice)
           Well -- I painted them all!
           (she shudders with release)
           It's TRUE! I did every single one --
          She gestures, then catches sight of a Walter street scene.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Well, every one except that street
           scene.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           But I did the rest. Every Big Eye!
           And nobody will ever know. But YOU.
          Rembrandt pants and BARKS.
          Margaret chuckles, then goes to work. She pulls a CURTAIN
          across the sliding glass door. At her easel, she squirts a
          tube into a well and starts mixing colors.
          Rembrandt jumps on the couch.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           No you don't! It's nice to have
           company, but that sofa is new.
           (she pushes him off)
           Let's find you some carpet to lay on.

          Margaret goes over to a CLOSET. Rembrandt follows, curious.

<b>          IN THE CLOSET
</b>          Margaret turns on the bare bulb inside. It's filled with old
          easels... cans... junk...

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           I think there's a scrap back here...
          She rummages, sliding the junk aside. In back is a TATTERED

<b>          WOODEN CRATE.
</b>          Hm?

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Well what's this?
          Margaret swings the bulb closer. The crate is covered with
          SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS and international markings.
          Margaret's interest is piqued. She tugs at the lid, pulling
          it off. Revealing inside a STACK OF STREET SCENE PAINTINGS.
          Ten or fifteen of Walter's canvases.
          Or so it seems.

<b>          TIGHT - MARGARET
</b>          She peers closer.

<b>          TIGHT - THE PAINTINGS
</b>          The top painting is a typical Parisian street scene: Cobble
          stones, a man carrying baguettes, an old lady selling roses...
          But down in the bottom corner is the signature: "S. CENIC"

<b>          TIGHT - MARGARET
</b>          She sucks in her breath, shocked. She examines the painting.
          Then, she hurriedly grabs the next canvas. It's another
          sunlit scene: A quaint Parisian cafe, a man playing accordian,
          and in the bottom right corner... the signature: "S. CENIC"
          WHAT?! Margaret grabs the next canvas. "S. CENIC"
          The next canvas.
          The next canvas!
          They all are signed "S. CENIC"
          Margaret starts hyperventilating.

<b>           66.
</b>
                         
          She thinks, then suddenly bolts from the closet.

<b>          INT. PAINTING ROOM
</b>
          Margaret races, rushing up to Walter's painted street scene,
          hung on the wall. We PUSH IN TIGHT, as she shoves her face up
          to the canvas, so close we can see the brushstrokes --
          As we MOVE IN TO THE SIGNATURE. Simply, "W. KEANE"
          Margaret's face is flushed. She gazes at the name... then
          rushes back to her work area. She manically hunts: Brushes,
          tubes, rags -- and an EXACTO KNIFE.
          Ah! She runs back to Walter's painting. Heart pounding, she
          grazes the knife up against the signature, then DIGS.
          And -- the "W. KEANE" flecks off. Revealing... underneath...
          the name "S. CENIC"

          A grandfather clock says 10:15. Margaret sits gloomily,
          staring at the clock. Clutching a drink.

          Suddenly, keys in the door. Walter swings in, tanked and full
          of life. He skids across the marble, humming to himself --
          when -- he's startled by his wife. He jerks.

           (he winks, loosey-goosey)
           Stumbled onto some hot gossip: Madame

           Straight from Taipei! I think we

</b>           You think? I dunno -- I thought you
           could whip off a doodle of Chinatown.
           With a cute little kid, sort of a big-

          Margaret's anger is raging. She glares, steely.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           No, Walter. She's a dignitary.
           Doesn't she deserve a piece that comes
           straight from you?

<b>                          (SHARP)

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Yeah? Maybe you're right. She
           probably doesn't have a Parisian
           street scene hanging in her palace.
          Margaret nods, as if they've settled something. She turns to
          walk away -- then suddenly SPINS.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek already

<b>                         ON WALTER

          Margaret stares, eyes sharp.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Cenic is the name of the artist who
           did all your early paintings.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Huhhh?
           (spinning his lie)
           Urgh... oh! CENIC!
           (he laughs crazily)
           Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All
           my art school pals loved my scenic
           views, so they called me "Scenic"!
           But since those Frogs can't pronounce
           a hard "e," I became "Cenic."
          He looks up at her hopefully.
          But she shakes her head.

</b>           (unyielding, scrambling)

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Then why do you paint over the name?
          Walter gasps, floored.
          Margaret bores in.

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           A bit of advice: Don't use a water-
           base over an oil. It flecks off.
          Walter cowers.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           You sound crazy! For God's sake.
           You've... you've SEEN me paint!!!!

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           No, I haven't.

<b>                          (QUIET; STRONG)
</b>           I always thought I had... but it's

<b>                          MARGARET
</b>           Have you even been to Paris?
          Walter blanches. He shakes, broken up.
          He looks away, then staggers to a chair. He falls into it.
          Trembling. Not able to look her in the eye...

          Then, without comment, she storms away. She SLAMS the door
          shut. BANG!

          Margaret makes Jane breakfast, scrambling up eggs.
          Jane glances over her shoulder -- and notices Walter in the
          living room, asleep on the couch.
          An awkward pause. Jane says nothing.

<b>          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

          Margaret is making the bed. Straightening the pillows.
          In the b.g., Walter silently creeps into view. Shamefully
          standing in the doorway. Not speaking...
          Margaret knows he's there, but doesn't acknowledge his
          presence. Finally, without making eye contact --

          He nods.

<b>          INT. HOUSE - LATER
</b>
          Margaret sits, unmoving, trapped in the big house. Outside, a
          JAPANESE GARDENER trims the hedges.
          Margaret stares at the walls, a smothering Walter Hall of
          Fame: Framed magazine articles on Walter, smugly posed with
          the Waifs.
          She swallows, then gently opens a dresser drawer. Inside is
          an ORIGINAL WAIF from long ago. A small oil of Jane, when she
          was a toddler.
          Margaret stares... and then her face slowly crumbles.

<b>          INT. PAINTING ROOM - DAY

          Margaret huddles with a SKETCHPAD. Rembrandt is at her feet.
          She's drawing. She looks up, as Walter anxiously enters.
          He's holding a drink. He clears his throat.

          He trails off, unsure where this is going.
          Trying to rouse her, Walter rushes to an easel and throws up a
          blank canvas. She eyeballs him.

           it first!
          Walter tightens, feeling stupid. He lets go of the canvas.
          Margaret stares, deciding. Then, she tosses him a PAD.
          Walter catches it. Slowly, he crosses over...

<b>          ANGLE - MARGARET AND WALTER
</b>          They peer at each other, like a Mexican standoff. Then, he

          Margaret easily outlines a head, then two circles for eyes.
          Walter tries copying, but his eyes are misshapen.
          Again, Walter copies, but he's wobbly. Angry, he scratches it
          out.
          Margaret tries to help, guiding his hand. Insulted, he pushes
          her off. He CRUMPLES the page.
          NEW TACTIC: Walter grabs her sketch. He puts it on a LIGHT-

          Walter stares.
          Then, he furtively glances at Margaret's work. Comparing...
          The realization slowly sinks in. He has no ability.
          A sadness swells into fury... and suddenly Walter GRABS HIS
          CANVAS and SMASHES IT AGAINST THE EASEL. CRASH!! The canvas
          SHREDS. The frame blasts into pieces!
          Walter spins. He glares at one of Margaret's finished

          A sign says "TOMORROW FOREVER."
          Below, two tiny figures walk in: Canaday and an obtuse CIVIC

          fabulous -- an old-money mansion filled with stuffy BLUE
          BLOODS, all tuxes and gowns.
          In the doorway appear Walter and Margaret. They're dressed to

          Walter takes the woman's hand. She smiles stiffly, silently

</b>           It's a decree of legal separation. I
           would appreciate if you signed it.

</b>           Granted, our romance may have seen its
           better days. The bloom is off the
           rose.

<b>                          (BEAT)
</b>           But I'm looking out for both of us.
           What about Keane Incorporated?! We're
           a professional couple. Like Roy
           Rogers and Dale Evans.

</b>           Whew. It hurts to hear you say those
           words.
          Silence. He is feigning "hurt feelings." Struggling for a
          response. Finally, his thoughts sharpen up, smart and shrewd.

           all rights to every painting ever
           produced.

          can push her further...

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Uh -- okay. And... then, we have to
           consider future revenue stream.

           do you need?

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           It's -- the marketplace! I gotta stay
           fresh. Surely you understand?

<b>                          (DEADLY)

           my term: You'll have to paint me 100
           more waifs. 100 more Walter Keanes!

          WOMEN, patiently walking toward the isolated house.
          Margaret stares, puzzled. The women come closer. They are
          Asian, dressed in formal dresses. Curious, Margaret creeps
          over, spying on them...
          They walk up and ring the bell. DING-DONG! An unsure beat...
          then Margaret opens the door. The ladies smile politely.

          a Bible. Walter slaps down his hand.

<b>                          BAILIFF
</b>           Do you swear to the tell the truth,
           the whole truth, and nothing but the
           truth, so help you God?

</b>
<b>           YESSS!
</b>          Walter bounces out, a bit manic. He runs back to his lawyer
          table, then spins to address the empty witness stand.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Mr. Keane. There has been a lot of
           innuendo and contradictory testimony
           about the genesis of the "big-eyed
           waifs." Would you mind clarifying to
           this court, once and for all, who
           spawned these paintings?
          Walter sprints back into the witness stand. He sits, then
          reacts coyly, as if he's surprised.

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           Why -- I created the children.
          Walter starts to stand again -- but the Judge SLAMS his bench.

<b>                          JUDGE
</b>           The choreography is not necessary.
           Just sit down and testify.
          Oh. Walter sits, then gathers his thoughts...
          We slowly PUSH IN. He smiles, wistfully...

<b>                          WALTER
</b>           I've had a wonderful life. I've been

          Walter's face is grimly blank.
          Margaret proceeds. Slowly, she pushes her chair from the
          table and rises.
          Walter doesn't move.
          Margaret walks over to the closest EASEL, then sits. She ties
          on a smock over her checkered dress.

          to his seat. His face tight, his expression queasy. Staring
          off to some faraway place.
          Margaret looks up at the CLOCK. 3:20.
          Okay then. Totally calm, in a motion she's done so many
          times, she focuses on the canvas and starts outlining a Waif.
          Everybody watches. Effortlessly, she pencils the EYES. They
          are enormous. The largest orbs she has ever done.

          composition. Then, she reaches for... the PAINT.
          She unscrews a tube and squirts it on the palette. She rests
          it on her lap and starts mixing a flesh tone...

          Hesitantly, visibly shaking, he rises from the table.
          Margaret notices this.

          step. Suddenly -- he SQUEALS.

          She's not surprised. This was his only way out.
          A look between them -- and then she cocks a half-smile and
          turns back to the canvas. She squirts out some white oil
          paint, then begins painting the eyes.

<b>                         WALTER
</b>          sinks down in his chair, beaten. All life gone.
          He stares at the emerging canvas, eyes wide, and we PUSH INTO
          WALTER'S FACE. He is witnessing the end of his empire... the
          destruction of everything that makes him who he is.
          We push in TIGHTER... TIGHTER... until the screen fills with
          his two eyes.
