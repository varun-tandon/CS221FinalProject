          stabbed straight into his abdomen. CAKED BLOOD all around

          uses to cover his work table.
                         
          -- He tears an air hose from one of the space suits, tapes it
          to the tent, hangs it from the roof. Now he has a chimney.
                         
          -- Mark vents pure oxygen from a tank, lights it with a spark
          from battery wires. Whoosh. Points the flame at the wood
          shavings. Now he has a small torch.
                         
          -- Mark holds the torch, starts the Hydrazine flow. The
          Hydrazine sizzles on the iridium and DISAPPEARS.
                         
          FOLLOW Mark's gaze up to the chimney. FLAME BURSTS start
          sputtering out from the hose. Mark grins. It's working.
                         
          Mark checks his instruments. Watches the temperature
          carefully. Repeats the process.
                         
          We may also notice Mark is wearing the protective inner
          lining of his EVA suit. Along with goggles. An oxygen mask

           supposed to land at the Schiaparelli

           seventeen minute gap. It's just the way
           the orbits work. So... it's possible we
           missed something.

          Panicked breaths. Ringing ears.
                         
          Mark struggles to stay conscious. His head bleeding. Jesus
          Christ. What just happened?
                         
          He looks through the window. Sees the collapsed Hab. The
          debris of ruined equipment scattering the field between them.
                         
          Psssssshhhhhhhh...
                         
          Mark wipes the blood from his brow, rolls to his knees.
          Struggles out of his suit. Checks his wounds. He's alive.
                         
          Psssssshhhhhhhh...

          Air.
                         
          The airlock is leaking.
                         
          Mark's heart starts to pound. He searches frantically for
          the leak, checking every seam, every inch of fabric...
                         
          Psssssshhhhhhhh...
                         
          Mark checks his arm computer. Oxygen flow steady. This will
          keep him alive. For now. But he has to find that leak...
                         
          Think, Watney. How do you find an invisible leak?
                         
          He does an inventory. He has his toolkit. He has the patch
          kit from his suit. Think, Watney...

          He pulls the knife out of the toolkit...
                         
          And cuts his own hair.
                         
          He hacks a chunk clean out of it. Holds the loose hair
          tight. Then he goes back to the arm computer. BOOSTS the
          oxygen flow. Now, all I need is a spark...
                         
          Yanks the WIRES from the power generator free. Strips the
          casing. Here goes nothing...
                         
          He holds the wires in the oxygen flow, rubs them together to
          create a SPARK. WHOOSH. He lights the hair on fire,
          creating the key to his plan:

          towards the floor...
                         
          Heading right through the microscopic TEAR in the fabric.
                         
          Mark grins. I've got you. Goes back to the toolkit. Finds
          that old stalwart of every NASA space mission: Duct tape.
                         
          He tears a piece free. Seals the hole. The hissing stops.
          Mark breathes. Okay...

          Mark cuts off one of the arms from his EVA suit. Cuts it
          into one square piece. Opens the patch kit. Works fast to
          glue the square over the area where the faceplate used to be.
          Then glues the arm-hole shut.

          The airlock ROLLS.
                         
          It's clumsy -- like rolling a phone booth from inside -- but
          it works. The airlock rolls a little less than a meter.

          close to the Hab.
                         
          Mark exits the airlock. He's wearing the patched-up suit.
          Which means his faceplate is completely covered with fabric,
          and he only has one arm free.
                         
          He points the free arm in front of him and begins to walk.

</b>                         
          Mark is using the camera in his arm computer to navigate.
          The camera projects an image onto the inside of the
          faceplate. Which is now fabric. It's crude, but it'll work.
                         
          MARK'S POV: Mark hurries through the rip in the airlock.
          Stumbles through the deflated Hab, past the mess of debris,
          heading for the bunk. Finds what he's looking for...

          everywhere. But the worst part?
                         
          Mark's crops are RUINED.
                         
          Mark stares at the disaster of frozen soil and uprooted
          plants. All his work. His lifeline. Destroyed.
                         
          He stares at the mess for a long time.

           even use words like "fast" when

           doing it in hopes I won't raise any

           questions out of the way up front. Yes,
           I did, indeed, survive on a deserted
           planet by farming in my own shit. It was
           even more disgusting than it sounds.
           Let's never speak of it again.
