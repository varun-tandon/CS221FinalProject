    A MAGNIFICENT CASTLE. Resplendent, bespeaking great wealth and  
    power. The grounds and stonework immaculate.

</b>              Once upon a time in the hidden heart of
              France, a handsome young Prince lived in
              a beautiful castle...

    RACK FOCUS to a single RED ROSE clinging to a rose bush on a      
    stormy spring night. A WEATHERED HAND plucks the rose.

</b>              Although he had everything his heart
              desired, the Prince was selfish and                     
              unkind.

    TIGHT ON THE PRINCE being groomed by his servants. (We do not
    see their faces.) A FRENCH MAID paints an exotic animal mask
    on the Prince's face with a feather brush. A TALL VALET drapes
    the Prince with an elaborately bejeweled coat.

              objects...

    The MAID dusts his wig with powder -

    bring more light.

    A CANDELABRA is lifted to the preening Prince as he looks at
    himself in an ornate HAND MIRROR.

<b>3   INT. BALLROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                                   3

    The ornate room is filled with BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE from all              
    corners of the world, each on display for the Prince's                
    pleasure. A circle of eligible maidens bow their heads.               

    Seated in a throne chair dominated by a majestic COAT OF              
    ARMS, the Prince snaps his fingers impatiently at an ITALIAN          
    MAESTRO, who smiles, revealing comically rotten teeth.                

    The maestro sits at a harpsichord and motions to his wife, a
    LARGE DIVA holding a TINY BICHON FRISÉ. As the music begins,
    the Prince steps forward.

    The diva fills the room with a voice as big as her frame.
    The Prince performs a ROUNDELAY with several debutantes:

<b>                        DIVA
</b>              Oh how divine
              Glamour, music and magic combine
              See the maidens so anxious to shine
              Look for a sign that enhances
              Chances
              She'll be his special one

<b>5   INT. BALLROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                                   5
</b>
    The dance speeds up. The Prince connects momentarily with a           
    beautiful woman -- but quickly moves on when his eye catches
    someone even more dazzling:

<b>                        DIVA
</b>              What a display!
              What a breathtaking thrilling array
                  (coos to the dog)
              Every prince, every dog has his day
              Let us sing with passion, gusto
              Fit to bust - oh
              Not a care in the world

    KNOCK KNOCK. The Prince stops. Then a gust of wind blows open  
    the windows. Sconces flicker and go dark. The figure enters
    in silhouette, hobbling on a CANE.

    Furious, the Prince grabs a lit candelabra from the Footman.
    He rudely pushes through the crowd, sweeping people from his
    path. He crosses to the windows, finally revealing --

    AN OLD BEGGAR WOMAN shivering from the rain. She looks to the
    Prince with hope and offers him -- A RED ROSE.

<b>                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>              Then, one night, an unexpected intruder                     
              arrived at the castle, seeking shelter
              from the bitter storm. As a gift, she
              offered the Prince a single rose.
<b>                                                            3.

The PRINCE'S HAND waves her off.    The woman begs on her knees.
The Prince motions to the staff.

<b>                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>          Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the
          Prince turned the woman away. But she                      
          warned him not to be deceived by
          appearances, for beauty is found within.

The majordomo and footman approach to usher her out.   The woman  
lowers her head as if to cry --

<b>                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>          And when he dismissed her again, the old
          woman's outward appearance melted away
          to reveal...

Suddenly, the old woman's cape and hood cocoon.    AN ERUPTION OF
LIGHT as she transforms into...                                      

<b>                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>          ...a beautiful Enchantress.

The wind picks up inside the room.   Frightened, the Prince          
falls to his knees.

<b>                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>          The Prince tried to apologize but it
          was too late. For she had seen that
          there was no love in his heart.                            

As the Prince begs for mercy, his body begins to transform.          
His jewelry pops off. His clothing rips as he grows larger.

<b>                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>          As punishment, she transformed him
          into a hideous beast...

The guests scream in horror and flee. But pushing his way            
through the crowd, A YOUNG BOY slips into the ballroom,
watching in wonder as -- the PRINCE'S SHADOW twists into the
<b>SHADOW OF A HIDEOUS BEAST.
</b>
The boy's mother frantically follows him inside --

entertainers and the dog trapped in the room.

     Years later, the enchanted castle stands isolated. The         
     property is surrounded by an ice hedge. The only sound is the
     grim winter wind. As we move closer:                           

<b>                         NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>               As days bled into years, the Prince
               and his servants were forgotten by the
               world. For the Enchantress had erased
               all memory of them from the minds of                      
               the people they loved.                                    

<b>7    EXT./INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT            7    
</b>
     At the highest window of the west wing, we see THE BEAST. The  
     ROSE, already wilting, floats before him. To protect it, the
     beast has covered it with a glass bell jar.                    

<b>                         NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>               But the rose she had offered was truly
               an enchanted rose. If he could learn to
               love another and earn their love in
               return by the time the last petal fell,
               the spell would be broken. If not, he
               would be doomed to remain a beast for
               all time.

     TIGHT ON THE ROSE -- another petal drops.

<b>                         NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>               As the years passed, he fell into
               despair and lost all hope. For who
               could ever learn to love a beast?

<b>8    EXT. BELLE'S COTTAGE - MORNING                                 8
</b>
     The front door of a cozy cottage opens to reveal -- BELLE, a     
     pure beauty blessed with intelligent, fiercely inquisitive eyes.
     With book in hand, she takes a deep breath of morning air and
     gazes toward the church which peeks above the village rooftops.

    On cue, the villagers begin their day. A HOUSEWIFE opens a           
    window, nods to a WOMAN shaking out a rug nearby. A BUTCHER          
    opens his shop, waves to a COBBLER moving past with his cart.

    An old VAGRANT is the only one to notice Belle, smiling at her  
    as he's tossed inside a HOLDING TANK by two GENDARMES.

    Belle weaves between the villagers, making herself invisible.        
    She passes a harried BAKER, buys a baguette --

              The same old bread and rolls to sell

    Belle approaches JEAN, the potter, tending to his MULE.

    Jean scratches his head, trying to remember something.    He         
    searches his cart which is loaded with pottery.

<b>                        BELLE
</b>              Good morning, Monsieur Jean.   Have you

              remember what. Well, I'm sure it will
              come to me.

    As she leaves:

     As the boys scramble into school, Belle steps on the stones
     over the duck pond -- revealing GIRLS forced into "woman's       
     work" chores, washing clothes in the circular laverie.
     They're surrounded by women kneading clothes on barrels.

     returns it to the shelves of the town's "library": a COUPLE
     DOZEN BOOKS in total. She remains hopeful.

      Looking down on the village is GASTON, a dashingly handsome       
      war hero clad in a dazzling gold breastplate. The only thing      
      bigger than his muscles is his ego. Strapped on his saddle        
      is a musket and the spoils of his hunt: rabbit, fox, and
      fowl. Riding beside him is Gaston's long-suffering aide-de-

Gaston and LeFou ride through the village gates. Gaston         
motions toward Belle in the village square. Geese flock         
around her feet, seeming to follow her.

          Who is beautiful as me
          So I'm making plans to woo and marry

          handsome brute

As Gaston dismounts, the lasses get splattered with mud from    
his horse's hooves. LeFou shoots them a look, whispers:

pursuit. He grabs flowers from the PERFUME STALL and makes a

     in a Parisian garret, painting his wife's portrait as she holds

He goes back to tinkering. Belle gazes at other music boxes,
each a small work of art, depicting famous landmarks from
around the world.

Maurice can see this line of argument doesn't do much for his    
daughter.

      Maurice turns to the music box as if to change the subject.        
      But looking back up to Belle's eagerness, he relents.

      Belle tends to the family's old glue horse, PHILIPPE.

      Surrounded by design sketches, Belle's workbench features a        
      small model of her `washing machine' prototype. Belle places       
      the miniature barrel in position... fastens a rope to a            
      leather strap... shaves chips off a block of soap... collects

     Belle tosses clothes and some soap chips into an empty BARREL

     With a smile, Belle points to the rotating barrel, which now    
     resembles a very early Whirlpool washing machine. Belle takes  
     her book and quietly begins to read. After a moment, she looks

     We have entered another world. A light, whirling snow
     descends on Maurice, dusting his coat. The clippity-clop of
     hooves echo in stillness.                                          

     Suddenly, A WHITE WOLF roars out of the bushes, barely missing  
     them. Gaze darting, Maurice notices WHITE WOLVES running on an  
     icy ledge above him. The wolves keep pace, massing to overrun
     him.

     Maurice urges his horse on, but his rickety cart starts to
     buckle. A HARNESS IS LOOSE.                                        

     The wolves leap in front of the cart, which comes undone,
     tipping over on its side. The chest of music boxes smashes open 
     on the ground. Maurice is launched up onto a ridge -- and finds 
     himself face-to-face with the snarling and scarred ALPHA WOLF.  

     Terrified, Maurice turns and begins sliding down the snowy ridge

     Philippe rides. PAWS crush twigs -- SLAVERING JAWS -- EYES mad  
     with hunger -- a gleam of FANGS -- Philippe gallops. Maurice
     races toward the CASTLE ICE GATES -- which churn open as the    
     wolves draw near.

     Maurice and Philippe speed through the gates as the wolves skid
     to a stop, their HOWLS turning to YELPS OF FEAR.

     colonnade filled with WHITE ROSE BUSHES. Just beyond, he sees      
     the door to the STABLES swinging in the wind. A LAMP has been

     Famished, Maurice sits, tears off a hunk of bread and devours         
     it ravenously.                                                        

     As Maurice looks around for something to wash down the food, a  
     CUP OF TEA slides into his hand. Maurice calmly gives the cup a 
     double-take. Meet CHIP, an 8 year-old boy tea cup. He           
     whispers:

               because it might be scary. Sorry.

     Maurice chews, smiles benevolently.

     Like any sane person, Maurice backs toward the door.       He bows    
     and calls into the shadows...

     Maurice rides Philippe away from the castle.        He notices the

     Maurice dismounts, checking to see that he hasn't been                
     followed from the castle. He strokes his nervous horse,

     We catch GLIMPSES of A DARK SHAPE moving atop the colonnade.          
     A taloned PAW. A swishing TAIL.                                       

     Philippe snorts, sensing danger. Maurice spies a single               
     PERFECT WHITE ROSE among the others.

      Pricked by a thorn, he pulls his hand back -- then tries           
      again. He PICKS the rose -- only to hear a booming ROAR from       
      above.                                                             

      ANGLE ON MAURICE -- terrified as the dark shape leaps down         
      from the colonnade. Maurice drops the rose, stumbling and          
      falling as a DARK SHADOW is cast over him.                         

      Philippe breaks his harness, whinnies in terror and flees,         
      charging through the castle grounds and out the ice gates.

      A first whisper of dawn as Philippe bursts out of the forest.

      whinny disturbs her. She looks up to find Philippe, thirsty
      and exhausted.

      reins. In dread, her gaze darts to the woods.

      Sunlight barely seeps through the thick branches lighting
      Belle's way as Philippe gallops past the FALLEN CANE TREE.

      Belle races through the enchanted woods, coming upon Maurice's  
      tipped over wagon. She sees the broken chest and scattered      
      music boxes.                                                    

      With a mix of apprehension and determination, Belle sets her

      Club held high, ready to defend herself, Belle cautiously eases
      the door open and peeks inside.

      The atmosphere of the castle presses in on Belle. Creepy DRAGON
                                                                     
      STATUES on the staircase seem like they're watching. Eerie     
      SHADOWS stretch down impossibly long hallways.

</b>                Who said that? Who's there?

      Belle reaches the spot where she heard the voices. No one
      there. Only a clock and candelabra. Suddenly, a COUGH echoes  
      through the castle. Belle grabs the candelabra and climbs a   
      long staircase. The clock shudders with dread.

The beast roars. Belle spins quickly, swinging her club to    
strike, but the figure jumps onto another staircase. Belle
searches the shadows. The voice circles her.

The only part of him that seems human are his eyes. BLUE.

     herself for his retaliation. Instead, she hears -- CLANG.

     With that, she pivots and swings her father through the door
     just as the beast slams it shut. Maurice trips to the ground,

     Through the latticework, Belle sees the beast and her father         
     disappear down the corridor. She rushes to the window and

Belle wipes her tears and stands.    She grabs a small stool,
ready to strike.

Like seeing a mouse, Belle bashes the candelabra. It grunts as
it clatters on the stone floor. The candles extinguished.

WHOOSH -- the first candle relights. WHOOSH -- the second.      
Illuminated by the two arm candles, Belle makes out EYES and a
rudimentary "FACE" in the design.

MADAME DE GARDEROBE yawns loudly.

Garderobe's gilded arms stroke Belle's shoulder and face.

Garderobe's doors open and a few moths fly out.

<b>                    GARDEROBE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh, how embarrassing.

Garderobe places a large HOOP over Belle's head, and proceeds      
to create an outfit using fabric and her pinking-shear hands.      
FROUFROU, a piano stool, runs in, barking like a dog.

     Froufrou tugs at the fabric, helping Garderobe complete the        
     outfit -- which is garish and too too much, all wrong for          
     Belle.

     With a deep bow and a whistle for Froufrou, Lumière drags     
     Cogsworth out. Plumette and Froufrou follow. Garderobe calls  
     out after her beloved dog.

     The door closes. Belle is alone. Garderobe instantly falls         
     asleep with a big SNORE. Belle has one beat of... where the        
     hell am I? She ducks down, then crawls out from underneath
     the enormous dress, which remains standing.

     Belle looks around the room with one thing in mind: escape.
     She quickly moves to the window. Opens it. She looks down          
     at the 100 foot drop leading to the grounds.                       

     Belle turns back to the room, and gazes at the dress.   An         
     idea taking shape.

     Amidst the animal heads, antlers, and drunken villagers, there
     is an even sadder sight -- GASTON. He drowns his sorrows in ale 
     while LEFOU listens.

<b>                         GASTON
</b>               Picture it, LeFou -- a rustic cabin.
               My latest kill roasting on the fire.
               Adorable children running around us
               while my love rubs my tired feet. But                    
               what does Belle say? "I will never

     The village lasses perk up.   "Yes!   There are other girls!"

The lasses deflate. "Awww!" LeFou decides it's time to cheer
up his best friend/boss. Thus begins "GASTON."

<b>                    LEFOU

LeFou gives a nod (and a large tip) to the FIDDLE PLAYER in the  
corner, who nods back, and begins to play...

          You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley
          And they'll tell you whose team they
          prefer to be on!

LeFou hops onto the bar, squeezing himself between TOM, DICK,    
and STANLEY.

LeFou hails a BARMAID and buys everyone a round of drinks.       
The villagers raise their mugs and cheer.

LeFou moves his shirt up his arm to show an old wrestling wound -
a nice teeth impression courtesy of Gaston. The villagers gasp.

Gaston leaps onto the bar, and is handed a huge blunderbuss,     
with which he mimes shooting LeFou.

Gaston spits a big gloppy mess into a spittoon: bullseye!   Then,
he moves around the inn, holding court.

          eggs
          So I'm roughly the size of a barge!

The crowd hollers. Gaston jumps on a long table. The table's  
height plus his massive frame make him seem 10 feet tall.     

He engages in a dance-break sword-fight with several VILLAGE

     The beast enters the dining room and sits at one end of a
     long dining table. He looks at his place setting, surprised
     to find flatware and crystal. Confused, he looks up.

     THE BEAST'S POV rises to find another place setting at the
     other end of the long table. When he notices the romantic
     candles, he swats his own place setting off the table in

     The mirror lights up and gives him a view of Belle at the          
     bedroom door. She turns, slides down the wall, and curls her       
     knees up to her. A look of dread on her face.                      

     Her fear crushes the beast. The mirror magic fades, and he is
     left with his own reflection and self-loathing. He lowers the
     mirror to reveal the glass jar by the open window.

     In the jar, the ENCHANTED ROSE hangs in mid-air. The rose is
     wilting. Most of its petals have fallen. Rage evaporating,
     replaced by shame, the beast lowers his head...

     ... as ONE MORE PETAL DROPS.

     The image moves inside the jar. We see the beast through the
     glass as he leans down, peering in at the petal as it reaches
     the bottom and shrivels. As it does, we hear a far off RUMBLE,  
     as if the foundation of the castle is trembling.

The tea is poured into Chip, who wheels over to Belle.

Belle picks up Chip and brings him up to her mouth. Little
Chip finds himself face-to-face with the most beautiful girl
he has ever seen. She takes a sip.

     Plummette uses a silver platter to turn a shaft of moonlight     
     into a SPOTLIGHT. As Lumière begins "BE OUR GUEST."

Belle sits down in a chair, which moves in, bringing her
closer to the table. Lumière motions up to Plumette to

Cadenza plays a dramatic scale as a table cloth UNFURLS, and   
Lumière jumps up and LANDS in a pose. Cadenza ends his scale on
the wrong note. Lumière shoots him a look, Cadenza plays the
right note, and Lumière turns to Belle and smiles.

Flute glasses fill up with champagne and then break into a Bob

before she sips.

Belle reaches again for food but is stopped by Lumière's
melodramatic histrionics. He wraps himself in a napkin for
the full Martha Graham effect.

around his neck and continues on.

Belle tries to stab a bite as the food moves past her, as if on
a conveyer belt. Sliding past her, Cogsworth wobbles.

On the floor, snow swirls around Lumière. We pull out to see

     From overhead, a la Busby Berkeley, we reveal desserts, teacups,

     Mrs. Potts descends, jumping onto her tea trolley -- and notices

     door -- slightly ajar.

     Furniture lies in rubble, curtains are shredded -- evidence of
     the beast's temper. Wary, Belle investigates when --

<b>     SHE GLIMPSES EYES PEERING AT HER OFF TO THE SIDE.
</b>
     With a start, Belle wheels to find -- the eyes belong to a royal
     portrait. The subject seems to be a TEENAGE BOY but his face
     has been SLASHED BEYOND RECOGNITION.

     Only the eyes survived. Bright blue. Engaging. Resembling the
     eyes of THE BEAST. She realizes that this is the "prince of a  
     fellow" Mrs. Potts was referring to.                           

     Belle leans in to study the painting. A ROYAL FAMILY stands by  
     the castle. The FATHER's image has been slashed. The QUEEN
     remains pristine. Kind. Beautiful.

     Belle moves past a large four-poster bed, its faded coverlet       
     gray with dust, like no one has slept in it for years. On          
     the floor, she sees a makeshift bed made of straw, torn bits       
     of fabric and crumpled blankets: the resting place of a            
     nocturnal carnivore.                                               

     Belle turns and sees the glow coming from the GLASS JAR by an
     open window leading to the balcony. Inside the jar -- THE
<b>     ENCHANTED ROSE.
</b>
     Mesmerized, Belle approaches the rose. She lifts the jar,
     leaving the rose unprotected. She reaches out to touch the
     rose. A shadow cuts across Belle's face.

        the bell jar.

a FROZEN POND. Philippe doesn't hesitate. He gallops onto the  
ice, and across the pond. The sound of ice CRACKING under his  
hooves is deep and low. And increasing.                          

Philippe's hooves slide on the ice.   The wolves close in.         

Philippe makes it across the pond onto land.   But before          
Belle can feel any relief --                                       

A WOLF'S JAWS snap at Philippe's thigh. Then another. The          
horse bucks wildly -- causing Belle to makes a controlled          
leap onto a snow bank. She seizes a thick branch and wields        
it as a club -- as the wolves surround her, jaws slavering --

Belle swings her club as one wolf lunges at her, its bared         
teeth like razors. She beats it away. She turns to confront        
another -- it bites the branch clean out of her hands.             

Belle turns, looks up -- on a rock promontory, the scarred         
ALPHA WOLF is about to take a diving leap onto her. It             
jumps, and she flinches -- but just as the wolf is about to        
makes its horrible landing --

<b>THE BEAST APPEARS --
</b>
-- and catches it in mid-air! With supernatural force, the         
beast hurls the wolf across the frozen pond, howling!              

All the wolves dive on the beast at once, tearing shreds from      
his cloak. He strikes at them -- wolves scurry, yelping --         

The oversize ALPHA WOLF climbs onto the beast's back, goes         
for his neck. The beast slams together the wolves on his           
arms, dropping them -- then reaches back and seizes the            
Alpha. WOLF and BEAST snarl inches from each other -- the          
beast squeezes --                                                  

Then hurls the Alpha into a stone ledge -- CRACK -- knocking him
out. The remaining pack retreats in panic, their yelps echoing
through the trees.

TIGHT ON BELLE -- watching as the beast whimpers in pain. His
shoulders slump. He collapses in the snow. This is her chance.
Belle could run. She looks past Philippe, to the woods -- to  
freedom. But then turns back, and slowly approaches the wounded

Belle covers the beast with her blanket.   He stirs.   One eye
opens.

      plants his face in the bowl. Looks up a second later having    
      inhaled the soup, half of which is dripping from his fur. Belle

     In the fresh snow, Belle brushes Philippe's coat. The beast     
     looks at Belle -- she nods -- and he pets the horse. Philippe  
     reacts skittishly, causing the beast to withdraw. Belle takes

Belle notices something tucked into a corner of the crib.          
She pries it loose. It is a BABY'S RATTLE carved into the

      stops, seeing Chapeau. He bows to her, silently, sadly.          
      Choking back tears, she is gone.

      enter. The door barely hangs on its hinges.

      Villagers hold up torches. The flickering light reveals
      FURNITURE. Chairs. A coat rack. A feather duster. A
      candelabra. A tea pot and teacup. A harpsichord.

      Mrs. Potts. Brings his torch close to study her.

firecracker explosions that send villagers scattering.

      With no hope left, the beast turns away from Gaston, whose

      On the turret below, his claws make contact with the slanted
      rooftop and break his fall. He hugs the rooftop, heaving.

      Gaston looks down over the edge of the turret. He pulls his

      With that, Belle snaps Gaston's arrows over her knee, and

      Gaston's pistol. They struggle.                                    

      With Gaston on the back foot for a split second, Belle yanks the
                                                                      
      pistol hard. Gaston, not letting go, swings with it, and
      seeking balance on a loose stone, he drops off the side of the
      turret!

      Gaston's reflexes are quick. He lets go of the pistol, grabbing
                                                                     
      a gargoyle and swinging himself down through a window of the

      Gaston's pistol, in the meantime, clatters down, coming to rest  
      on the landing of a stone footbridge below.

      Wounded, the beast climbs around the lower turret. All around  
      him, turrets quaver and crack. The castle is imploding.

      sideways onto another.

      Belle reaches the landing at the bottom of the spiral staircase,
      and leaps down onto another adjacent landing. She looks out,
      trying to see the beast through the turrets.

      The beast swings around a third parapet and leaps onto another.
      He's now as far as he can get from Gaston.

      Finally, Belle reaches a point where she can see the beast on
      the faraway turret. She screams out as his grip slips.

Gaston drops onto the walkway lined with gargoyles, landing        
directly between the beast and Belle. He sneers -- the upper       
hand is still his. His eyes search for a weapon... he grabs        
a stone spire, and breaks it off.

With superhuman agility, the beast makes a giant leap from the
far parapet back toward the central turrets. Back toward Belle. 

Belle descends the stairs, finally reaching the beast's lair.

The beast lands on the gargoyle walk and Gaston jumps out,
bringing his club cracking down on the beast's back. The
beast roars in pain. But he pushes past Gaston.

With Gaston landing blow after blow on the beast's back, the
beast staggers down a set of stairs onto the landing of a stone
footbridge (where Gaston's pistol came to rest earlier).

Belle watches the beast lumbering across the footbridge -- which
crumbles under each mighty footfall.

The beast reaches the cupola on the far side, directly
parallel to the lair. One giant leap stands between him and        
Belle...

Gaston lifts the club to deliver the death blow -- when the
beast snatches it. He yanks the club away and hurls it
against a far wall.                                                

With a snarl, the beast's paw is around Gaston's throat. He
lifts Gaston and swings him out over the edge of the landing.

but he controls himself -- and his anger fades.

      him away down the outer staircase of the cupola.

      chasm that separates them.

      across to the lair balcony.

</b>                No!   It's too far!

      But the beast has already gotten down on all fours. His hind
      claws dig into the stone. And then he's off, gaining speed as
      he runs on all legs. Belle gasps -- and the beast leaps.

      He's airborne, flying over the chasm -- and he just makes it to
      the balcony -- landing on all fours! He rises, and smiles.       

      BOOM! The beast roars in agony. Past him, across the chasm,
      Belle spots Gaston on the crumbling walkway, pistol back in
      hand. He grins as he reloads for the kill shot -- and as Belle
      watches, helpless, he takes aim again -- and fires.

      The beast drops -- just as the walkway beneath Gaston             
      collapses. In an instant, there's nothing beneath his feet,       
      and he disappears, screaming, in a cascade of stones.

      Belle cradles the beast's head. Anguished. He lies there,
      breathing heavily. Softly, the beast rests his paw on Belle's
      hand. Fading, his eyes look at her with perfect love.

      Just as he leaps up, his features fade away and gravity takes       
      over. The saucer plummets, shattering. But Chapeau catches          
      Chip in mid-air -- and lovingly places him, inanimate, onto         
      the trolley cart beside Mrs. Potts.

      her hand on the bell jar -- which explodes and releases a           
      wave of rose petals, whirling into the air.                         

      A golden light begins to emanate from Agathe. It encircles          
      the beast and he too begins to rise. Belle gets to her feet,

      Magic explodes outwards. And with it, the dawn breaks. The     
      castle transforms like someone is giving it a wash of gold. The
      magic spreads across the balcony as the sun rises on the
      terrace, traveling down the castle facade -- creepy stone

      As the light passes over, an upside-down FROUFROU transforms    
      back into a tiny BICHON FRISE basking in the sun. He leaps up  
      and chases his tail (still a tassle), then trots over to CHAPEAU

      with his walking stick. As the dog weaves through his    legs,       
      the valet loses his balance and bumps into the trolley   cart        
      holding Mrs. Potts and Chip. It starts to roll toward    the

      The valet backs into Garderobe, who waddles in and out of            
      sunlight, changing from wardrobe to human to wardrobe again.         
      Cadenza's face comes alive as he sees the wardrobe falling           
      onto him. As it crashes, the wardrobe's doors fly open,              
      sending out a flurry of garments. We follow them back to the
