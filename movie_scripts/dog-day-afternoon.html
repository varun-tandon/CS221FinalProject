</b>
<b>               EXT. ELECTRIC SIGN
</b>
               It FILLS THE SCREEN (designed to exactly FILL THE FRAME size 
               of whatever ratio we're shooting in).  It says:

<b>                                           2:51
</b>
               This message will be a little cryptic to the movie audience 
               on an essentially BLACK SCREEN.  HOLD for a beat, then it 
               changes: the lights flash this sign, which should explain it 
               to everyone:

<b>                                           94Â°
</b>
               And a slow distant ROLL OF THUNDER in the far distance; now 
               the SOUND of media begin to come up loud, under:

<b>               EXT. FLATBUSH AVENUE - DAY

               LONG SHOT down the Avenue, 400 mm lens, heat waves shimmering, 
               thousands of old people, and people with children in strollers 
               moving restlessly about in the heat on those endless miles 
               of benches.

               The SHOT is ON SCREEN only for a beat or two, then gone...

               We are SEEING HEIDI, though we don't know it yet - she's 
               just another pretty 175-pound Italian girl with two kids, 
               KIMMY, JIMMY, about four and five years old.  Right now she 
               is a lump of browning flesh, shining with oil among rows of 
               similar ladies (mostly thinner, but all with a certain 
               unhealthy softness about them) laid out in rows and groups 
               across the sand.  SHOOT LOW AND LONG, so heat shimmers rise, 
               as though the heat were baking the oil out of this mob, 
               visible suntan oil pollution...  Heidi's transistor blasts 
               ROCK MUSIC into the air.

</b>
<b>               INT/EXT. SONNY'S CAR - STREET - DAY
</b>
               It is parked in a drab Brooklyn street.  Beside the car stands 
               SAL, medium height, also good-looking in an intense boyish 
               way.  His eyes dart about suspiciously, the ever-watchful 
               Sal.

               There is a watchful reserve in Sal that contrasts to Sonny's 
               outgoing bounciness: first impression is Sonny is all bark; 
               Sal is the bite.  Sal is dressed in impressive blue suit 
               style, he looks like a kid trying to impress the Godfather.  
               He even wears a hat.  Now, matching Sal's preparations inside 
               the car, he checks his tie's alignment, shoots his cuffs and 
               is ready...

               Meanwhile, on their car radio:

<b>                                     ELTON JOHN

</b>
<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE BY CAR
</b>
               As he turns, from the back of the car, JACKIE appears with a 
               huge florist box, tied with ribbon.  Jackie is an eighteen 
               year old with bad complexion and in contrast to Sonny and 
               Sal is dressed in teenage sloppiness.  Adidas, T-shirt, 
               bowling jacket, jeans.  He is uncertain: waits for directions 
               from Sonny.  Sonny takes the florist box from him.

               We see a water truck drive down the street, followed by 
               Sonny's car, which drives up near bank.  It stops, Jackie 
               gets out, crosses to bank window, peers through, then

<b>               ANGLE INSIDE CAR
</b>
               returns to car.  Leans in, has fake conversation with Sonny.

               They are waiting.  Sonny checks his watch, turns to Sal in 
               back seat:

<b>                                     SONNY
</b>                         30 seconds, Sal...

               They wait.  At appropriate moment, Sal exits car, walks toward 
               bank.  Slowly Sonny gets out.

<b>               INT. BANK - DAY
</b>
               A slightly seedy little branch bank, old yellow brick, blond 
               varnished wood, a rubber plant, an American flag.  Through 
               the windows we SEE HOWARD, the aged black bank guard, in 
               uniform, taking down the American flag from outside.  Past 
               him comes Sal carrying an attache case.  He passes Howard 
               coming toward us through the door into the bank.  As he passes 
<b>               CAMERA:
</b>
<b>               INSERT: BANK CLOCK
</b>
               as it CLICKS from 2:57 to 2:58 PM.

<b>               MOVING SHOT WITH SAL
</b>
               as he moves toward the left-hand deposit-slips desks.

               He picks out a car-loan application slip, then walks toward 
               the manager's desk (as the sign on the desk proclaims) of 
               PATRICK MULVANEY.  Sal sits down, his back to Mulvaney, facing 
               the front door of the bank.  Mulvaney is on the phone.

<b>               ON DOOR
</b>
               as Sonny bustles through in his bouncy dancer's walk.  He 
               carries the large florist box.  He moves toward the left- 
               hand deposit-slips desks, takes one out and begins to fill 
               one out.

<b>               ON HOWARD
</b>
               as he pulls out the keys, attached to the belt of his uniform.  
               Jackie approaches the door of the bank and stops, neither in 
               nor out, as though he can't make up his mind.  Howard watches 
               him, waiting patiently, keys in hand, folded flag under his 
               arm.

<b>               CLOSE - SAL
</b>
               still sitting, back to Mulvaney, watching Jackie's approach 
               and entrance, ready to move on cue.

<b>               ON DOOR
</b>
               on Howard as he looks at Jackie, still half in, half out.  
               Howard speaks to him:

<b>                                     HOWARD
</b>                         Closing time; you want in or out?

               Jackie steps in and as Howard locks the door to prevent more 
               customers from entering, Jackie walks toward Sonny, filling 
               out a slip at the left-hand area.  CAMERA FOLLOWS Jackie.

               He stops at deposit-slips desk, next to Sonny.

<b>               CLOSE - SAL
</b>
               as if by pre-arranged signal, Sal now stands up, moves to 
               the side of Mulvaney's desk.

<b>                                     SAL
</b>                         You the manager?

<b>               ON MULVANEY
</b>
               who is still on the phone.  He gestures at the sign on his 
               desk that says so, and gestures for Sal to sit down.

<b>               ON SAL
</b>
               as he sits, producing as he does a machine pistol, which he 
               holds on Mulvaney's chest, out of sight from others in the 
               bank.

<b>               MULVANEY
</b>
               His mouth simply stops, and he stares at the gun.  Mulvaney 
               is a comic opera Irishman in his early fifties, florid... 
               cheerful, bushy eyebrows; he acts out everything he says...

<b>                                     SAL
</b>                         Just go on talking, like nothing was 
                         happening, okay?

<b>                                     MULVANEY
</b>                              (into phone)
                         Listen, lemme call you back.

               He hangs up, and looks from the gun up to Sal's blank hard 
               face.  To his own amazement, he grins: a hopeful grin that 
               says: "Like me - don't hurt me."  And he's embarrassed by 
               it.  As we watch, his smile turns sour.

<b>               HIS POV - FLASH
</b>
               Sal's absolutely unmoved face.

<b>               TWO SHOT - SONNY AND JACKIE
</b>
               Jackie moves over to Sonny.

<b>                                     JACKIE
</b>                         Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.

</b>                         Jackie - what are you talking about?

<b>                                     JACKIE
</b>                         Maybe we can take something smaller... 
                         like a Spanish grocery.

<b>                                     SONNY
</b>                              (indicating what's 
                              happening with Sal 
                              and Mulvaney)
                         It's too late - just get away from 
                         me - don't talk to me now - go over 
                         to your place...

               Jackie moves to another deposit-slips desk - takes one out 
               and begins to fill it out.

<b>               ON TELLER'S CAGE AREA
</b>
               as a LADY with a BABY in a stroller moves away from the Teller 
               and starts to walk toward the front door.  DEBORAH is marking 
               figures on a piece of paper at 1st Teller's cage.

               SYLVIA and MIRIAM stand behind her - their backs to Sonny.

               Howard, who has put the folded flag in a plastic bag in a 
               front desk, follows Lady toward the door.  He unlocks the 
               door and hands the Baby a lollipop, courtesy of the bank, 
               and she exits the bank.

<b>               CLOSE - NEW ANGLE - SONNY

               glancing at clock, taking a sharp deep breath...

               staring at Mulvaney.

               the ruins of his smile still on his face.

<b>               HOWARD

               straightens up from locking the door; the figure of the Lady 
               and the Baby can be seen receding outside...

<b>               SONNY
</b>
               seeing that the bank is closed, locked in, with no customers, 
               crosses toward the front teller's cage area, carrying the 
               florist box.  As he reaches the other side, he rips open the 
               box and takes the rifle out and aims it level onto SYLVIA 
               BALL, the teller, who automatically takes the "closed" sign 
               and holds it in front of her face as though to protect herself 
               from the rifle.

<b>                                     SYLVIA

<b>               TWO SHOT - MULVANEY AND SAL

               as Mulvaney stands and yells to Sylvia...

<b>               ANGLE ON BACK OF BANK, REST ROOM AREA
</b>
               as MARGARET, an accountant, comes out of the ladies' room, 
               starts to cross downstage toward her desk, sees what is 
               happening, and momentarily freezes in her tracks.

<b>               SONNY
</b>
               The cues have got all fucked up, but he's so programmed and 
               ready, he can't adjust, so the speech he had ready comes out 
               now:

<b>                                     SONNY
</b>                         Okay, this is a stickup!  Nobody

                         center - get in the center!

               Sylvia and Edna start to move toward the rear of the bank, 
               toward Margaret's desk.

<b>               MULVANEY
</b>
               aghast at his own outspokenness... Sal holding the gun 
               levelled on him.

                         Do what the gentleman says, Howard.

               Sonny sees that Howard is useless, so he runs to Howard, 
               grabbing the keys from him and pulls Howard along with him 
               to the front door.  Jackie unlocks the door, and Jackie, 
               with a last apologetic glance, gives his gun to Sonny and 
               vanishes into the sweltering afternoon.  Sonny then frisks 
               Howard and has a sudden afterthought as he locks the door 
               again.  He quickly unlocks it and shouts out at Jackie.

                         Hey, gimme the keys - the keys!

               Jackie stops, fumbles for keys, crosses back to Sonny with 
               them.

               Sonny turns into the bank once more, as Jackie walks off 
               toward the subway, pointing inside at a desk near the window 
               as he does, to point something out to Sonny.

               Sonny now crosses to desk that Jackie indicated, as everyone 
               watches him, as though it's all in the game.

               JENNY, a young, frightened girl, peeks out from under the 
               desk, obviously afraid to reveal herself.

               Sonny starts to move toward the front of the bank.  Sal turns 
               so he can cover everyone.  Sonny turns to order Howard.

               Howard belatedly leaps to work, pulling drapes that screen 
               off the interior from outside.  The door has no drapes or 
               blinds and thus when the drapes are closed there is a corridor 
               of space across the street we will always be able to see.  
               And from which people outside will always be able to see in.  
               As Howard finishes the task, he then walks back to the huddled

               bolted to a wall bracket covering the tellers' area.  He 
               whips out a spray can and gives the lens a shot of red paint.  
               There are three cameras in all, each of which he sprays.

               After spraying the three cameras, he has reached Mulvaney's 
               desk area.  The girls are scattering to group farther back 
               and Sonny and Mulvaney are heading for the vault.

               MIRIAM, a young, awkward, overweight Jewish girl, chewing 
               gum with nervous machine-like rapidity, moving toward the 
               vault.  The gate is closed, and she holds one key and Mulvaney 
               the other.  They pass Sal, who now holds the others in the 
               bank under his gun while at the vault gate.

               quickly reaches out and grabs Mulvaney's hand, and looks at 
               the key he has extended.  He explodes.

               Sonny holds the key right in the middle of the FRAME where 
               Mulvaney and the audience can SEE the key has a tiny 
               projection or spur at the end.  If this key is used, the 
               spur triggers a silent alarm.

               Mulvaney nods and picks out a key that is identical except 
               for the spur.  He shows it to Sonny.  Sonny nods.

               as Mulvaney carefully uses the safe key to unlock the gate.  
               Miriam is crying as she unlocks her side.  The gate swings 
               open.  Sonny shoves Mulvaney inside and, as he passes Miriam, 
               notices her tears.

               She just stands there staring into his face like a hypnotized 
               chicken, the tears streaming down her face.

               Sonny stops, staring at her.  Mulvaney, starting to open the

               Again, Mulvaney starts to cross back to his desk, again 
               followed by Sal.  Sonny yells out to Mulvaney as he crosses 
               to answer the phone.

               They cross toward the last drawer area (#5).  Miriam is still 
               crying silently.  Sonny holds out the plastic bag for the 
               checks for her.  She drops it.

               With everything in the bag, Sonny now takes the register and 
               starts to move the two girls toward the rear near the vault.

               as he moves toward the rear (Sylvia and Miriam now re-joining 
               other women), to get a wastebasket.  Accomplishing this, he 
               starts to burn the pages of the register, tearing out pages 
               as he does so.  It's smokey as hell, but not burning well.  
               He drops it, smoking, into the wastebasket.

               to him and starts to unfasten his belt to remove the keys.

               on Sal's part.  He is smiling a little, and for the first 
               time, looks happy, and that's what makes him seem dangerous.  
               He's looking forward to an excuse to kill.  It's here now: 
               survival.  There is something almost sexual about the way he 
               settles his body down behind the weapon, getting ready for 
               the squeeze on the trigger, the report, the violent shove of 
               recoil against his muscles and sinews.

               As Sal starts to herd them into the vault (Sylvia helping 
               Howard, still with the cup of water), Mulvaney is still on 
               the phone.  Sonny moves down to get the money bag atop the 
               teller's cages and we hear Mulvaney on phone.

                         What property is that, Mrs. Anterio?
                         The Third Avenue property - you 
                         already got a second mortgage on.  
                         We discussed it before...

               The girls are afraid; Miriam unlocks the gate as Sonny uses 
               Mulvaney's keys to the matching lock.

                         You won't close the vault?  How can 
                         we breathe?

                         gate...

               Sylvia, helping Howard, is the last to go through the gate.  
               As Sonny is about to lock the gate, she turns to him.

</b>                         You see... now they all gotta go.

               As Sylvia starts to move out, Sonny starts to cross ahead of 
               her.

               Mulvaney finishes his phone conversation.  He moves toward 
               the group at the vault.

</b>
               as Sonny sprints for the door to the Ladies' Room.

<b>               INSIDE LADIES' ROOM
</b>
               It is a little lounge; sitting on a couch under the window, 
               making up her face (or painting her toenails) and listening 
               to her tiny transistor radio, oblivious to all that's 
               happened, is MARIA, heavily-painted and voluptuous Latin 
               girl.  Sylvia, following him in, is shocked.  She's forgotten 
               about Maria.  Now she runs over to her, puts her arms around 
               her.

                         What the...

               Maria is about to protest, but Sylvia grabs her and starts 
               to hustle her out.

                         bathroom - come on...

               He moves with them back to the vault area, herds them into 
               it.  At this point, PHONE RINGS AGAIN (#4).  Sonny moves to 
               get the empty wastebasket, shoving it into the vault for the 
               girls to use in case of emergency.  Mulvaney moves to his 
               desk and phone.

               Mulvaney has by this time answered the phone, and is now 
               holding it out to Sonny.  HOLD THE BEAT...

</b>
               They both stare at Mulvaney.  Sonny slowly moves toward 
               Mulvaney.  For the first time since he entered the bank, 
               he's quiet and slow.  He takes the instrument and slowly 
               puts it to his ear.  The group from the vault now slowly 
               starts to move out to listen to the conversation.

               Sonny turns and looks out through the door.  Sure enough, in 
               the window of the barbershop across the street, the dim figure 
               of a man on a telephone can be SEEN looking out toward us.  
               He wears a hat in spite of the weather and a cigar is clamped 
               in his mouth.  He is an old-time, hard-nosed, uneducated, 
               street-wise, sarcastic New York cop, outspoken, rude and 
               sentimental.  Right now he's a distant silhouette and a voice 
               on the telephone.

               holding the phone.  Listening to the voice of his death 
               speaking in New York accents.

                         stupid and not get anybody hurt.
                         You come to the front door with hands 
                         folded on your head, unnastand?  
                         Nobody's gonna shoot or...

               Sonny slowly, almost sadly, puts the telephone receiver back 
               down, cutting off the little voice at the other end.  He 
               looks up at Mulvaney, then to Sal.

               Sonny is pacing back and forth, trying to figure out what to 
               do.

               she is, how serious, grotesque, and funny it all is.  He 
               takes the time to be tender with her, as though she were a

               away, as though to give her privacy.

               to them.

                         Let's just take it a step at a time.

               Sonny now turns toward Mulvaney.  Howard lies down, head on 
               jacket, in the vault.

                         what they learn, Sonny.

               At some point in their move toward the rear door, Sylvia 
               exits the Ladies' room and moves back toward the group.

               They look at it.  It is big, black, steel and seems solid.  
               Sonny tests it.

               He has found a big office machine, a Xerox or whatever, which 
               he now starts to push toward the door.  On the opposite side, 
               Mulvaney starts to pull it toward the door.  It's very heavy 
               and they have to strain to budge it at all.  Meanwhile:

                         with the guilty.

               They have the machine almost to the door now, with Mulvaney 
               almost pinned between the machine and the door.  He eases 
               himself out.  Looks at the gun, then at Sonny, then they 
               shove the machine against the door.  Sonny then gives Mulvaney 
               his jacket to put on again.

                         if she's got young kids.

               Finished with the task, Sonny takes his gun and with Mulvaney, 
               they start to cross back toward Sal and the rest of the group.

               As it banks steeply we can see past Pilot to bank, and cops 
               around car.  We see a small crowd being held back by a few 
               police still setting up barricades.  It is the first 
               indication of the crowd event it became.  It also sets the 
               geography for us, but very quickly another copter swims into 
               view and the two circle each other.  The other copter -- 
               only feet away -- is a TV news helicopter, with a big camera 
               sticking out the open door on our side.

               It is turned down by the Cameraman to focus on the bank.  A 
               COP in the police helicopter yells through his bullhorn at 
               the TV Cameraman.

               the copters, and on the TV set likewise, and the voice of 
               the Announcer.

<b>                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
</b>                         ...police as yet have made no contact 
                         with the bank robbers who are locked 
                         in the bank...

               There is a HAMMERING at the door, and the men at the TV set 
               barely have time to look around before several burly Cops 
               wearing flak vests and helmets and carrying sniper rifles 
               with telescopic slights move through the room, ignoring the 
               men.  They move out onto the fire escape, a couple going up 
               higher, settling themselves down to aim in their rifles on 
               the front of the bank.  A lot of AD LIB dialogue, but what 
               we note is the Cops, as a man, take a look at themselves on 
               the TV.

<b>               EXT. BANK - DAY
</b>
               The FRAME is full of cop faces... tough, mesomorphic faces 
               with a layer of fat under the skin, increasing as age.  They 
               have the look of cops: alert, curious, weighing.  They are 
               city cops; they don't have that old-fashioned condemnatory 
               expression, there is an element of playfulness in their nature -- 
               the fact is they love their work, which is criminals.  There 
               is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impulse 
               in everybody, and a matching fury in punishing it -- which 
               is the action of repressing their own strongly developed 
               criminal unconscious.  These are tense, funny, violent, and 
               rigidly controlled men.

               MORETTI is an old-line cop, a lot more relaxed than the 
               younger men and the cold professionals of the FBI, who as a 
               group resemble astronauts, and like them hide (but do not 
               deny) the psychic chaos underneath.

               Right now they are looking at the sky.  We HEAR a heavy 
               helicopter track.

               We feature SHELDON, the silver-haired FBI Agent-in-Charge, 
               who looks like an accountant, and Moretti, with hat and cigar, 
               and a face out of Warner Brothers movies of the Forties.  In 
               spite of Sheldon's age, Moretti plays though he's a smart 
               kid who still needs a little help.

               Sheldon is getting out of a gray car, wears a gray suit.  
               Three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ages.

               The three hang around him.  They approach Moretti who looks 
               at them without moving.

<b>                                     MORETTI

                         You men lookin' for protection?  We

                         take 'em out there in the street?

               Moretti looks at him, cheerfully sarcastic.

<b>                                     MORETTI
</b>                         I made an error in judgment.  I 
                         thought the sons of bitches would be 
                         overwhelmed with remorse at the sight 
                         of a police officer.  And you know 
                         somethin'?  Nobody has said hostage 
                         yet.  Unnastan?

               They are moving past Cops on the corner heading toward a 
               small barbershop across the street from the bank.  We now 
               sense the growing crowd, standing quietly, just staring not 
               yet knowing what's going on.

               From down the street come a group of odd-looking men in suits, 
               carrying all kinds of electric junk: The NEW REPORTERS.  
               They run heavily, sweating martinis and cigarette smoke...  
               they run up to Moretti and Sheldon, who walk along, trying 
               not to catch an eye.

                         young fella without the hat is FBI.

                         if you spell it wrong.

               They have arrived at the barber shop where Moretti fights 
               his way inside.

<b>               INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY
</b>
               A COP is talking on the wall phone as MORETTI, BAKER, etc.  
               are trying to get inside.

<b>                                     COP
</b>                         ...no, just get hold of Al, tell him 
                         to get the catering truck over to 
                         26th and Avenue B, there's a bank 
                         robbery in progress and big crowd.  
                         Big!  Tell him to bring ice cream -- 
                         I got to hang up.

               He hangs up and immediately begins thumbing through a POCKET 
               PHONE BOOK.  Throughout this Cop is engaged in personal 
               business on the fringe of this affair, and though he's on 
               duty he hardly knows what's happening on the robbery.  He's 
               trying to get his brother-in-law with the ice cream truck 
               down here, etc.

               Moretti has got the crowd cleared back, so that now we SEE 
               why this has been chosen as a tactical command post.  From 
               here, while talking on the phone, Moretti can see the bank, 
               and through the uncurtained door he can even see some distance 
               inside.

               Moretti picks up the phone.

<b>                                     MORETTI

                         be a direct line into the bank.

               Moretti is already dialing.  The phone is answered.

<b>               INT. BANK - DAY
</b>
               (Re Moretti's 3rd conversation on phone with Sonny.)

               The group inside the bank have now been waiting approximately 
               twelve minutes since anything last happened.  Sonny is seated 
               at Mulvaney's desk, all the phones off the hooks.

               The rest of the group is huddled around the vault area where 
               Sal is keeping his eye on them.

               Suddenly, Sonny jumps up and puts all the receivers back on 
               the hooks, crossing back to sit at Mulvaney's desk again.

               PHONE STARTS TO RING and Sonny picks it up.

</b>                         Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?

<b>                                     SONNY
</b>                         Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam 
                         veterans so killing don't mean 
                         anything to us, you understand?

               A cop passing by presses a portable two-way radio into 
               Moretti's hand: He accepts it and holds as though he expected 
               it.  The Cop passes the same type of set to certain other 
               officers.  These sets are tuned in to each other, and 
               throughout the movie, there is a constant background talk on 
               these sets.  This is police procedure; the orders are for 
               everyone to talk about everything.  If anyone has a question, 
               has heard a rumor or a sound, whatever, it is immediately 
               responded to, so that there can be the fewest possible 
               surprises.  Sample dialogue might go: "Did I hear a shot?" 
               "Over here, by the bank, there was a report like a gunshot, 
               inside."  "Roger, we heard that from the barbershop... it 
               was inside the bank."  "Barbershop, you can see inside?"  
               "Roger, we heard from the barbershop... it was inside the 
               bank."  "Barbershop, you can see inside?"  "Roger, this is 
               the barbershop, we see inside, the perpetrator is moving 
               toward the rear of the bank."  "Who's that guy walking through 
               the barricade?"  "The blue suit?"  "Yeah."  "Off-duty 
               Inspector come down to see can you use him."  Etc.  They 
               really do use the word Perpetrator, Felon, etc.  The Cop 
               handing out radios makes Moretti sign for it -- which Moretti 
               does during the following:

               Sonny moves with them toward the front door, his gun aimed 
               at them during the walk.

               Finally they arrive, and Howard moves toward the door by

               The Cops lower their weapons.  Moretti comes out on the 
               sidewalk.  He's eating an ice cream bar, and stands seemingly 
               at ease, an island of calm control in a storm of passion 
               about to be let loose.  The Cops are always about to explode.

               Sonny is about to open his mouth when a medium-size dark- 
               haired Man who has been standing among people behind the 
               barriers puts his head down and runs at astonishing speed 
               right across the street towards Sonny.  He catches everybody 
               so by surprise he is already on Sonny before anyone can do 
               more than start to yell at him to stop.  Sonny, himself, 
               can't believe it!  He is slammed to the ground and the Man 
               begins to punch him and beat him viciously.  Cops charge in 
               and with great difficulty pull him off.

               There's Heidi.  Her body lies exactly as before, baking in 
               the sun.  The transistor RADIO plays... she seems to be 
               asleep...

</b>                         ...the leader of the pair, a Vietnam 
                         veteran, Sonny Abramowicz, has 
                         demanded in return for releasing one 
                         of the hostages that police allow 
                         his wife to visit him at the bank.  
                         Police spokesman...

               Heidi sits bolt upright, stares at the radio, which continues 
               to blather on.  Abruptly she begins to gather up her things, 
               her children, in a characteristically scatter-brained and 
               hyperactive sort of way.  Heidi is a one woman panic:  she 
               hustles away across the broiling sand carrying the radio 
               wadded up in towels, and lugging a child, crying helplessly, 
               by one elbow, as though it were a handle, a silhouette against 
               the late afternoon sun, out of Fellini... meanwhile on the 
               SOUND TRACK we are hearing her voice.  It is a breathless, 
               harsh childish voice that pours out the words in a torrent:

                         the transistor, get outta here, who 
                         needs this?  I say Sonny didn't do 
                         it.  It's not him to rob a bank.
                         It's not him to hurt anybody, to 
                         threaten anybody, to steal or do 
                         anything wrong.  'Cause he's never

               TWO COPS get out of a squad car where they've been staked 
               out and move up to her.  They never really get in a word

                         ever do is put on his coat and go

               The group is now situated like this:

               1) MULVANEY'S DESK - the TV is on; seated in his chair, filing 
               her nails is MIRIAM.

               Seated to her left, having pulled the chair a patron uses, 
               is MARIA, watching TV and listening to her transistor radio, 
               against her left ear, at the same time.

               MULVANEY (at back water cooler - will eventually move back 
               to his desk, sit down to Miriam's right.)

               2) EDNA - is now behind the Tellers' cages, straightening up 
               the mess; she picks up the loose money that Sonny had 
               scattered thru the air, puts them into packets and ties them 
               with rubber bands.

               3) SAL - is seated in the rear Conference room, still holding 
               his rifle, feet up on the table.

               4) MULVANEY &amp; DEBORAH - at the rear water cooler (from which 
               she will move to see what's wrong with Margaret)

               5) MARGARET - seated at her desk, obviously ill, wiping her 
               forehead, head bowed.

               6) SYLVIA and JENNY - at far right table, doing a crossword 
               puzzle.

               7) SONNY - pacing back and forth Mulvaney's desk, posing a 
               legal puzzle for Maria.

               Sonny, his gun now lying across the top of Mulvaney's desk, 
               is pacing back and forth between the desk areas.  He's talking 
               to Maria in particular, but anyone in earshot in general.

               Deborah crosses to Margaret who is ill.  Deborah goes to 
               Sylvia - who returns with her her to Margaret.

               It should begin getting dark in through here.  It is very

               we can HEAR... as it goes on SHOT WIDENS to reveal the others 
               in various postures of waiting.  Sal more disheveled, Sonny's 
               restlessness is unabated; he paces about like a caged animal.  
               The voice on the phone is breathy and youthful: Sonny has 
               been listening for a long time.

               a trap door in the ceiling.  Mulvaney looks up at it.

               As Sonny is staring up at the trap door, thinking about what 
               to do, he hears a tiny scratching SOUND.

               Sonny, tensing like an animal, peers around wildly to locate 
               the source of the little scratching SOUND: like mice at a 
               steel door.

               and with the cartridge in the other hand, runs back toward 
               the back door again, jamming cartridge into rifle.

               At this point, Sal runs in from the Conference room, covering 
               everyone point-blank again, yelling for Edna to join the 
               rest of the group.

               and might even see the door knob move.

               were trying to work tubes under it to pump in gas, others 
               were trying a nylon line to the doorknob, the idea being 
               that if Sonny came out that way, the moment he began to open 
               the door the cops would yank it open, exposing him completely 
               and gun him down.  The cops SCREAM as the SHOT comes through 
               the door, showering them with brick fragments.  They scramble 
               over cars, over each other, over fences, running into other

               As the cops reach for the money, knowing it's bank money, 
               people in the crowd yell:

               Sonny holds up the money.  The crowd cheers.  He throws the 
               wad of bills and it scatters in the air.

               The WIND is blowing now.  Even some cops join the ensuing 
               melee to gather it up...

               as cops move forward and try to catch the bills.  Some blow 
               into the crowd.  Fights break out in the crowd as they 
               scramble for the money.  The crowd breaks the barriers and 
               swarms after the cash.  Cops try to retrieve bills; fist 
               fights, arrests.

               Sonny also watching the people.

               There is in both of them the same reaction of faint disgust 
               at the greed unleashed.  Sonny angrily hurls another bundle 
               after the first... then laughs as he watches the people 
               fighting.

               Moretti nods ironically at him.  Sonny turns and enters the 
               bank with the food.  The fighting goes on in the street.

               He puts it down in front of Mulvaney, on Mulvaney's desk.  
               Mulvaney looks at it, sickly.  As Mulvaney looks up at Sonny:

               Moretti, Sheldon, other top cops march fast-time toward the 
               barrier where uniformed cops stand around a limousine that 
               has drawn up to the barrier.  It is full of white-haired 
               officials, one of them the COMMISSIONER.  He has a voice 
               broken by whiskey, cigars, good food and yelling at football 
               games.

</b>
               It looks like they may be going into action.  Moretti's 
               attitude is not that subtly different now he's talking to 
               brass.  Commissioner doesn't get out; he talks through window.

               The Commissioner's hand, pudgy and freckled with age, covers 
               Moretti's where it rests on the door: he massages Moretti's 
               hand fondly.

               A lot of comfortable CHUCKLES inside the limo.  The 
               Commissioner's hand lingers on Moretti's -- they are fond of 
               each other, these men, linked in a relationship of a lifetime 
               of shared experience, of attitudes, of maleness -- an 
               accumulation of years of jokes about being late for dinner, 
               of women waiting and women panting with desire, men secure 
               in the bastion of their roles.  What is being passed on here 
               is a purely emotional force of approval and acceptance from 
               top to bottom of a social institution that is the last totally 
               masculine society: police.  The homosexual content of this 
               should not be lost: it lies in the comfortable fit of their 
               feelings, in the fact, simply, that they love each other, 
               for what they share.

               He leans down to get close to his commissioner, because he's 
               not fooled by the camaraderie into a false sense of security.

               The DRIVER of the police car gets out, with a huge grin on

                         hostages for their demands of a 
                         helicopter, a jet, and safe passage 
                         out of the country...

                         control it, Sal - let'em say what 
                         they want.  Forget it.  It don't

               FBI snipers area at positions, waiting.  A small group of 
               men make a last check.  A signal is given.  They get in their 
               car and drive away.  An FBI sniper lights a cigarette and 
               settles down to wait, moving his rifle to a comfortable 
               position.

               Sonny paces back and forth (with ad-lib dialogue to group).  
               Margaret, seated at her desk, has feet up on another chair 
               while Jenny sits on top of her desk.  Mulvaney is back at 
               water cooler, starting to feel very ill.  Miriam and Deborah 
               are seated at Mulvaney's desk.  Edna is seated at her desk, 
               while Sylvia sits on top of desk, talking on phone.

               Suddenly, the lights go out, leaving only emergency lights 
               on (4 in the main area and 2 at back door area).  Sylvia 
               immediately moves over toward the vault area and turns on 2 
               hand lamps.

               Both rush toward the front of the bank.  They see that even 
               the flood lights are now out, but across the street can still 
               be seen lights in the store windows.  Sonny rushes to a near-
               by phone to try to reach Moretti, but even the phones are 
               dead.  They hear Moretti's voice over a bull-horn outside:

               Sonny moves toward the front door.

               as the door opens and Sonny peeks out, the once-illuminating 
               floodlights now out.

</b>                         Moretti?  What the fuck is goin' on?

               There's no answer.  Sonny steps out into the street.  He 
               can't see anything anymore.  The atmosphere is suddenly 
               chillingly dangerous: the crowd SHOTS "come out of the dark" 
               and "we can't see from here".  The street seems empty except 
               for a few threatening silhouettes of heavily-armed cops.  
               Sonny responds with bluster.

               He steps out farther into the street.  From behind him, 
               SHELDON, the FBI man, approaches.  He is alone.  Unsmiling.

               Sonny dashes back into the bank.

               as Sonny rushes in, warns Sal about the FBI confrontation 
               he's about to have.

                         out to talk to him.

               At this, he walks back toward the door and exits the bank 
               again.

               Sheldon is walking toward Sonny as the latter exits the bank.

               Sonny crosses to Sheldon, grins, grabs him and executes a 
               very professional-looking pat-down search.

               He removes Sheldon's .38 from a shoulder holster, producing 
               it for the crowd with a flourish like a magician: some of 
               the old playfulness returns for a moment.  He carefully and 
               with showbiz flourishes searches Sheldon's thighs and groin.  
               The crowd HOWLS.  Sheldon bears it with stoic calm.

               as Sonny stands up from the search and finds Sheldon's eyes 
               locked to his with flat calm.

                         he hates my guts.  Not because it's 
                         a job.  Okay, let's go... but you 
                         gotta walk in backwards.

               The move toward the door of the bank, where Sonny opens the 
               door, preceding Sheldon, both men entering backwards.

               Except for the 4 emergency lights, it is very dark - and 
               very hot as Sonny and Sheldon enter the bank.  Sal now stands 
               behind the desks, covering Sheldon and the group assembled 
               at the vault.  Sheldon takes in every detail as he walks 
               toward the group in the rear, followed closely and covered 
               by Sonny.  As they near the desks, Sonny yells out an order

               Sheldon is watching Sal, trying to gauge him.  This is the 
               first time anyone from outside has seen Sal.

               Sheldon now walks closer to group, looking into the two small 
               examining rooms as he moves.  Sonny covers him every inch of 
               the way.

               but insinuating and conspiratorial.

                         death on our hands, but you handled 
                         it.  I respect that.  Don't you try

                         the whole fucken thing will be over.  
                         That would be all right too!  I 
                         said... I thought I would square it 
                         away with you... you know?  That I

               Heidi goes on and on, but Sonny just drops the phone on the 
               hook.  As he walks toward the rear of the bank, Sylvia, seated 
               atop Margaret's desk, gets off and follows Sonny toward the 
               Conference room.  At the same time, Edna is lifting Margaret's 
               feet up onto a chair and Jenny and Deborah start to walk 
               toward the Conference room, too.  Maria paces back and forth, 
               transistor to her ear.

               Sonny walks into the Conference room.  The doctor is through 
               examining Mulvaney.  Miriam is seated across the table from 
               him.

               recovering.

               Edna crosses to her desk - disgusted - and starts to tidy

               The giggle catches the edge of their panic and anxiety and 
               sweeps them into uncontrollable giggles and laughter: Sonny 
               roars.  Sal and Edna alone remain unsmiling.  After a few 
               seconds they force themselves to stop, to behave like they 
               should under the circumstances.  They are gasping and crying.

               It sets them off again.  They howl and giggle and laugh.

               Until at last they run down again.  At this point, Sal rushes 
               out of Conference Room.

               escorted by Sheldon, stands a figure, dumpy and gray, 
               tentatively waving, a figure that bends over baby carriages 
               in the park, picks beans one by one out of supermarket bins, 
               lip reads get-well cards in pharmacies.

               They hear Sheldon, outside, on bullhorn:

               She is down to one of the very last pieces of the puzzle and

               as the vehicle clears the crowd and slowly draws up in front.

               It is a long airport limousine of the type with many doors.

               It stops.  Everyone's attention is on it.  A black DRIVER 
               gets out, a gay Afro knit on his head, coke dealer's shades, 
               for the cognoscenti, one very long little finger nail, a 
               nifty Van Dyke style beard and one gold front tooth.  He 
               looks around, holding a sheet of paper.  Sheldon, others, 
               approach.  They are looking into the vehicles, opening doors,

               Pause.  Sheldon finally reluctantly nods.  Sonny motions for 
               him (the Driver) to step forward.  Before he can get in the 
               car, Sonny stops him.  Signals to him to get ready.  Gives 
               him a thorough pat search.  Thighs, the whole bit.

               It is tense.  The Driver seems uptight.  Sonny finds nothing 
               until he touches a breast pocket.  The Driver is very uptight.  
               Sonny reaches in, pulls out a -- tiny bottle, with a coke 
               spoon chained to the lid.  Before Sheldon can see it, but

               Driver on the buns.  The Driver laughs delightedly.

               He was afraid he'd get busted for the dope: the drive will 
               be a cakewalk.

               Only authorized personnel may previously authorized, and

               A middle-aged Man who looks like an overweight accountant, 
               in flak vest and helmet that seems too small, aiming through

               Something that looks like a multi-legged animal emerges.  It 
               is Sonny and Sal in the center of a tight group of the girls 
               and Mulvaney, so they are completely protected on all sides 
               by hostages.  Over their heads is thrown some drapes from 
               the bank that further prevent the police from drawing a clear 
               head on Sonny or Sal without hitting a girl.  In fact they 
               can't be seen at all.  This weird apparition appears, 
               hesitates.  The crowd YELLS: "SHOOT!"  CHOREOGRAPH THE ACTION 
               so the group hesitates, takes a step forward, then it's clear 
               Sonny can't see well enough to go direct to the car, and the 
               girls are uncertain which direction to go in, not having 
               been briefed.  So they stumble about, make false starts, and 
               finally arrive at the car, where one girl gets into the second 
               row of seats behind the Driver.  Then Sonny slides across 
               next to Driver.

               himself from the group and slips into the front seat, on

               Maria gets in the rear-most row of seats.  Sal next to her 
               in the middle and then another girl.  One woman, Edna, a

               and all of them come alert.  As Sheldon and the other FBI 
               men get out of their car, a pair of aircraft landing lights 
               become visible, taxiing towards the limo.

                         I forgot to ask to have food on board.

               Sheldon has been walking down to the limo.  He stops beside 
               Mulvaney and KNOCKS on the window.  Mulvaney rolls it down.

               There is silence inside the limo.  Mulvaney turns to Sylvia.

               They open the door.  They urge her out, and Maria goes with 
               a show of reluctance.

               As she stands up outside she is revealed to have a rosary 
               she's counting.  IMPROVISE goodbyes, tearful and fearful all 
               around.  Then:

                              (gives him her rosary)

               And Maria walks away.  Now the plane has taxied into position, 
               where it can be seen in floodlights.  It looks big and 
               impressive.  We know the FBI has snipers ringing it.

               looking at the plane, grasping his money and his gun.  The 
               rifle stands straight up between his legs.  Sheldon leans 
               down, peering in at him.

               in front of Sonny, behind Mulvaney.  For the first time he 
               smiles.  He realizes that escape is within their grasp.  The 
               smile transforms him from a formidable Mafia imitation into

               Driver starts to turn in the driver's seat!

               Sheldon brings up his hands to reach through the open window 
               to grab Sonny's rifle barrel, pushes it away, aiming out 
               windshield.

               Mulvaney sees them beginning their move and starts to duck.

               Sal begins to see movement out of the corner of his eyes and 
               is barely beginning to react.

<b>               DRIVER TURNING HAS A GUN OVER THE BACK OF THE SEAT!
</b>
               Sonny sees it, and Sheldon's hand grabbing the barrel of his 
               gun at the same moment.

               Sheldon drives hard into the side of the limo, reaching in.

               Mulvaney grabs the girl next to him and pulls her by the 
               hair down toward the floor.

               Sal, open-mouthed with amazement, is a split-second late 
               bringing his gun up.

               Driver completes his turn and has his gun leveled at Sal 
               between Miriam and Margaret in middle row.

               Sheldon grabs his rifle barrel and pulls hard.  Sonny lets 
               it go.

               Sal stares at the gun barrel, trying to get his gun up...

               Driver FIRES.

               Mulvaney hits the floor.

               Sheldon holds Sonny's gun.

               Sonny, CLOSE, watches.

               Sal, hit, slams back into the seat; the gun flies upward.  
               Another SHOT hits him, flinging his head back.

               Driver holds his third shot, turns to Sonny - holds gun to 
               his temple.

               Sonny looks down so he can see fully as:

               Sal's head snaps back for a split second and stares directly 
               into Sonny's eyes, upside down.

               He stares sadly, into Sonny's eyes.  As though he knew it 
               all along -- betrayed.

               And dies.

               The SHOT is ECHOING.  Now SCREAMS, YELLS, SLAMMING doors, 
               panic... Sonny's voice:  "Shoot me!  For God's sake, shoot 
               me!"

<b>               FULL SHOT
</b>
               They come pouring out of the limo, scrambling frantically 
               away from it.  The limo -- the people fleeing it.  Agents 
               pull people away from the car.

               Driver and Sheldon and Cops peer into the back.  Sal's body 
               lies slumped.

               Driver, Sheldon, other Cops stand about, recovering.  No one 
               makes the slightest sort of congratulatory move, it was just 
               another job.  Driver clears his weapon, hands it to Sheldon 
               to be filed in case of investigation.
