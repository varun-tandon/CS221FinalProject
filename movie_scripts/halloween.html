          A cold brick building. Isolated. Surrounded on all sides by      
          barbed-wire fencing.                                             
                         
          A RENTAL CAR pulls up to the SECURITY GATE. A SECURITY GUARD     
          checks the credentials of the driver. The Guard nods to the      
          GUARD BOOTH. The GATE OPENS. The rental car drives through.

          CLOSE ON: A HAND holding a MICROPHONE. The hand cranes the       
          mike around the to pick up sounds of maniacal laughter           
          echoing from the corridor.

          REVEAL: DANA HAINES (30's), activating a TAPE RECORDER. She's
          with AARON JOSEPH-KOREY (40); both scholarly, British. Aaron
          signs some documents at a CHECK-IN DESK. They look to each

          Among the SECURITY GUARDS, a NURSE works behind the security
          desk of what looks to be a minimum security institution. The
          nurse places a needle on a record player. A joyous song from
          a 1930's musical plays.
                         
          Aaron looks through the security window and sees a DOCTOR
          writing something down and speaking to a PATIENT and a guard,
          KUNEMAN. His ballpoint pen runs out of ink. He shakes it,
          discards it and then reaches into his lab coat pocket for a
          more elegant pen to complete his prescription and signature.
          He glances through the glass at his visitors.
                         
          Dana raises her mic to the door. WE HEAR SOUNDS through
          warped distortion. THEN: A loud BUZZER snaps us back to          
          reality as a ward activates the door lock.

                    clinical psychiatrists. And with
                    each, many different opinions.
                    Loomis reasoned that he was nothing
                    more than pure evil.

</b>                    Evil is not a diagnosis. Under my
                    care, we implemented a holistic
                    form of therapy. Since that time,
                    his tendency for violence has
                    essentially been erased.

                    display the limitations of my
                    analysis. Loomis saw Michael as a           
                    beast in the wild. He witnessed
                    human behavior at its most primal,
                    while the rest of us only have the
                    opportunity of observation in
                    captivity.

          Laurie arrives. She uneasily scans the neighborhood;
          surveying the street, the shadows, pumpkins on porches.
                         
          A firecracker POPS and she flinches.

          way down the street, lighting firecrackers-- POP POP.
                         
          Two more silhouettes join the Witch, a SKULL HEAD and a

          window of the crime scene.
                         
          She turns to the window of the next room.
                         
          The Shape stands staring at Laurie. The sight of him makes
          Laurie's heart drop. She GASPS. The look between the two has
          forty years of tension.

          Allyson gets up and walks backwards. She look to the front
          door and sees The Shape standing on the porch.
                         
<b>                                             ALLYSON

          Laurie turns and instinctively aims the gun toward The Shape
          and fires. The bullet blasts directly over The Shape's           
          shoulder. A porch light shatters.
                         
          -- Miss. She's out of bullets.
                         
          Laurie quickly drops the gun and pulls a large hunting knife
          out of a sheath on her belt. The Shape stands with a kitchen
          knife in his hand. A CLASSIC SHOWDOWN.
                         
          He steps off the porch toward her. Laurie looks back and sees
          Allyson stumbling backwards.
                         
          With the mind-set of a mamma bear, Laurie turns back to The
          Shape and charges him.
                         
          Their blades meet. Limbs entangled. The Shape loses blood        
          from his missing fingers, but his momentum is relentless. He
          drives his knife into Laurie's chest. She swings and slices      
          his arm.
                         
          Allyson screams.
                         
          On THE PORCH: We see Shanah slowly opening the front door
          with the POINT OF A HIGH TECH CROSSBOW.
                         
          After a brief struggle, The Shape twists his knife and forces
          Laurie to the ground. He pulls the blade out.

</b>                         
                         
          Shanah's eyes swell with fear. Her jaw shakes as she takes
          aim. She considers the shot but instead lowers the crossbow
          in defeat.
                         
          Then Laurie catches her eye from the ground. A neutral           
          expression of control that says everything.
                         
          The Shape lifts his knife back for the deathblow, and before
          it falls, Shanah raises the crossbow and pulls the trigger,
<b>          RELEASES HER ARROW.
</b>                         
          It penetrates The Shape from behind. Underneath his right
          shoulder. The point and beak jut out by inches.                  
                         
          The Shape DROPS HIS knife and pulls the pointer and slides it
          back and forth. He gets to his feet and struggles to remove
          it.
                         
          Allyson walks toward them and grabs the fallen knife.
                         
          She keeps The Shape at bay as she grabs her grandmother under
          her arms and drags her back through the yard.
                         
          The Shape stumbles forward into the woods.
                         
          Shanah runs to Allyson and Laurie. They help her to her feet
          as she bleeds. Nearly unconscious. They put pressure on the
          wound.

</b>                         
          In a flurry of motion and panic, Shanah and Allyson run with
          Laurie. As they struggle down the long, dark wooded
          driveway, they breathe heavily, exhausted physically and         
          emotionally. Feet drag, bodies strain. The effort is arduous.
                         
          Laurie looks back at The Shape disappearing into the trees.
          She is in and out of consciousness.

          Her whispers fall on deaf ears.
                         
          Shanah and Allyson miss it in the strain of their efforts.       
          They reach the gate which has been broken open.
                         
          Shanah holds Laurie while Allyson steps into the road and
          looks both ways.
                         
          Hawkins' abandoned squad car in one direction and a pair of
          headlights in the other direction.

          Allyson waves her arms as the headlights approach.
                         
          A PICK-UP TRUCK pulls over.
                         
          Shanah lifts Laurie toward the truck.   Allyson helps.           
                         
          THE DRIVER drops the gate of the bed of the truck.
                         
          The driver helps the severely injured Laurie into the truck.
                         
          Her daughter and granddaughter get in, sit beside her and
          hold her tight.
                         
          The truck ROARS INTO DRIVE and speeds down the road.
                         
          The woman rest, stunned and numb and reflective of the night     
          behind them.

          The Shape, wounded. He pulls the arrow from his chest and
          moves through the forest.
                         
          SIRENS WAIL in the distance. His WHITE mask catching the
          moonlight.
                         
          The Shape comes to a clearing. He turns and looks back in the
          direction of Laurie's house. He watches, BREATHING...
                         
          He touches his chest. Feels his wounds; his missing fingers.
                         
          We reveal that he is standing among the shattered artificial
          faces of mannequins.
                         
          The Shape walks to a tree and takes a seat. His head tilts
          back as his hand presses into his blood stained clothing. His    
          breathing deepens.
                         
          Exhausted, or possibly his last.
